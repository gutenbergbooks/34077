<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

  <p>The present paper was read in the first general meeting of the
  International Congress of Zoölogists at Leyden on September 16, 1895.
  Several points, which for reasons of brevity were omitted when the paper
  was read, have been re-embodied in the text, and an Appendix has been
  added where a number of topics receive fuller treatment than could well
  be accorded to them in a lecture. The address was first printed in <i>The
  Monist</i> for January, 1896, and afterwards in a German pamphlet.</p>

  <p>The basal idea of the essay&mdash;the existence of Germinal
  Selection&mdash;was propounded by me some time since,<a name="NtA1"
  href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> but it is here for the first time fully
  set forth and tentatively shown to be the necessary complement of the
  process of selection. Knowing this factor, we remove, it seems to me, the
  patent contradiction of the assumption that the general fitness of
  organisms, or the adaptations <i>necessary</i> to their existence, are
  produced by <i>accidental</i> variations&mdash;a contradiction which
  formed a serious stumbling-block to the theory of selection. Though still
  assuming that the <i>primary</i> variations are "accidental," I yet hope
  to have demonstrated that an interior mechanism exists which compels them
  to go on increasing in a definite direction, the moment selection
  intervenes. <i>Definitely directed <!-- Page 4 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>variation exists</i>, but
  not predestined variation, running on independently of the
  life-conditions of the organism, as Naegeli, to mention the most extreme
  advocate of this doctrine, has assumed; on the contrary, the variation is
  such as is elicited and controlled by those conditions themselves, though
  indirectly.</p>

  <p>In basing my proof of the doctrine of Germinal Selection on the
  fundamental conceptions of my theory of heredity, a few words of
  justification are necessary, owing to the fact that the last-mentioned
  theory has been widely and severely assailed since its first emergence
  into light and even repudiated as absolutely futile and erroneous.</p>

  <p>In the first place, many critics have characterised it as a "pure
  creation of the imagination." And to a certain extent it is such, as
  every theory is. But is it on that account necessarily wrong? Can not its
  fundamental ideas still be quite correct, and it itself therefore
  perfectly justified as a means of further progress?</p>

  <p>Surely my critics cannot be ignorant of the prominent part which
  imagination has recently played in the exactest of all natural
  sciences&mdash;physics? Are they unaware that the English physicist
  Maxwell "constructed from liquid vortices and friction-pulleys enclosed
  in cells with elastic walls, a wonderful mechanism, which served as a
  mechanical model for electromagnetism"?<a name="NtA2"
  href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> He hoped "that further research in the
  domain of theoretical electricity would be promoted rather than hindered
  by such mechanical <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>fictions." And so it actually happened, for
  Maxwell found by means of them "the very equations, whose singular and
  almost incomprehensible power Hertz has so beautifully portrayed in his
  lecture on the relations between light and electricity." "Maxwell's
  formulæ were the direct outcome of his mechanical models." "These ideal
  mechanisms"&mdash;so relates Boltzmann in the same interesting
  essay&mdash;"were at first widely ridiculed, but gradually the new ideas
  worked their way into all fields. They were themselves more convenient
  than the old hypotheses. For the latter could be maintained only in the
  event of everything's proceeding smoothly; whereas now little
  inconsistencies were fraught with no peril, for no one can take amiss a
  slight hitch in a mere analogy.&mdash;Ultimately Maxwell's ideas were
  philosophically generalised as the theory that all knowledge consists in
  the disclosure of analogies."</p>

  <p>But not only does it seem that there is little appreciation among
  biologists for the scientific import of imagination, they also appear to
  have little sense for the significance of theory. It is a favorite
  attitude nowadays to look upon theory as a sort of superfluous ballast,
  as a worthless survival from the epoch of decrepit "nature-philosophies."
  People pronounce with pride the miscomprehended utterance of Newton,
  <i>Hypotheses non fingo</i>, and place the value of the slightest new
  fact infinitely higher than that of "the most beautiful theory."<a
  name="NtA3" href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> And yet theory originally <!--
  Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>fashions
  science out of facts and is the indispensable precondition of every
  important scientific advance.</p>

  <p>Heinrich Hertz,<a name="NtA4" href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the
  discoverer of electric undulations, had the same thought in mind when he
  said: "We form inward representations or constructs of outward objects,
  so constituted that the results that follow logically and necessarily
  from the constructs are in turn always constructs of the results flowing
  naturally and necessarily from the objects." "These constructs or mental
  images copied after familiar objects possessed of familiar properties, so
  constituted that from their manipulation effects result similar to those
  which we observe in the objects to be explained. Experience teaches us
  that the requirements here made can be fulfilled and that consequently
  such 'correspondences' between reality and the supposed images [or, as
  Hertz says, between nature and mind] actually exist. Having succeeded in
  extracting from the accumulated experience of the past, representative
  images or constructs fulfilling all these necessary requirements, we can
  then reproduce by them in a short space of time, as we might by models,
  results that in the outward world require a long space of time for their
  actualisation or can be produced only through our personal intervention,"
  etc.</p>

<p><!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span></p>

  <p>Such representative models, or constructs, now, in my theory of
  heredity, are the <i>determinants</i>, which may be conceived as
  indefinitely fashioned packages of units (biophores) which are set into
  activity by definite impressions and put a distinctive stamp upon some
  small part of the organism, on some cell or group of cells, evoking
  definite phenomena somewhat as a piece of fireworks when lighted produces
  a brilliant sun, a shower of sparks, or the glowing characters of a
  name.</p>

  <p>The <i>ids</i>, also, are such representative models, and may be
  compared to a definitely ordered but variously compounded aggregate of
  fireworks, in which the single pieces are so connected as to go off in
  fixed succession and to produce a definite resultant phenomenon like a
  complete inscription surrounded by a hail of fire and glowing
  spheres.</p>

  <p>Owing to the greater complexity of the phenomena in biology we can
  never hope to reach the same distinctness in our constructs and models as
  in physics, and the attempt to derive from them mathematical formulæ by
  the independent development of which research could be continued, would
  at present be utterly fruitless. In the meantime it seems preferable to
  have some sort of adequate model to which the imagination can always
  resort and with which it can easily operate, rather than to have to
  revert, in considering every special problem of heredity, to the mutual
  actions of the molecules of living substance and outward
  agents&mdash;processes which we know only in their roughest outlines. Or
  is any one presumptuous enough to believe we can infer from our slight
  knowledge of the chemical and physical constitution of the germs of a
  trout and a salmon the real cause <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>of the one's becoming a trout and of the
  other's becoming a salmon?</p>

  <p>The fact is, we can make no show of accounting for the complex
  phenomena of heredity with mere <i>material</i> units; we can never reach
  these phenomena from below, but must begin farther up and make the
  assumption of <i>vital</i> units and <i>hereditary</i> units, if there is
  to be any advance in this field.</p>

  <p>It is undoubtedly a splendid aim which the newly founded science of
  developmental mechanics has set itself of laying bare the entire causal
  line leading from the egg to the finished organism; yet, however much we
  may wish to see the success of this plan realised, we cannot disguise the
  fact that little or nothing is to be accomplished by it in the settlement
  of the problems of heredity. It is impossible to suspend the study of
  heredity until this mechanics is completed, and even if we could it would
  help us little, for the riddles of heredity are not concealed in the
  ontogenesis of types, or, to give an example, in the developmental
  history of man <i>as a race</i>, but in the ontogenesis of
  <i>individuals</i>, in that of a <i>definite and particular</i> man. This
  last ontogenesis exhibits the phenomena of variation, of reversion, of
  the predominance of the one or the other parent, etc., and no one is
  likely to believe that inductive evolutional inquiry alone will ever
  afford us knowledge of these minute and delicate processes, which, in
  their bearing on the total resultant development, phylogenesis, are after
  all the most important of all.</p>

  <p>There is, accordingly, no choice left. If we are really bent on
  scientifically investigating the question of heredity, we are obliged
  perforce to form from the observed facts of heredity a highly detailed
  and <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>elaborate theory, on the basis of which we can
  propound new questions, which will give rise in turn to new facts, and
  thus will exercise a retroactive influence on the theory, improving and
  transforming it.</p>

  <p>This is precisely what I have sought to accomplish by my theory of
  Germ-plasm, as I stated in the Preface to the book bearing that name. It
  was never intended as a theory of life, nor, indeed, primarily, as a
  theory of evolution, but first and above all as a theory of heredity. I
  cannot understand, therefore, the animadversion, that my theory in no way
  furthers our insight into the mechanics of development. That is not its
  purpose; in fact, it takes the ultimate physical and chemical processes
  which make up the vital processes for granted; and inevitably it is
  constrained to do so. Its aim is to put into our hands a serviceable
  formula by means of which we can go on working in the field of heredity
  at any rate, and, if I am not mistaken, also in that of evolution. To me,
  at least, the newest results of developmental mechanics do not seem so
  widely at variance with the theory of determinants as might appear at
  first sight; so far as I can see, they can be quite readily made to
  harmonise with the theory, provided only the initial stage of the
  disintegration of the germ-plasm in the determinant groups be not
  invariably placed at the beginning of the process of segmentation, but be
  transferred according to circumstances to a subsequent period. The exact
  state of things cannot as yet be determined, so long as the mass of facts
  is still in constant flux.</p>

  <p>In any event I still hold fast to the hope which I expressed in the
  Preface to my <i>Germ-plasm</i>, that despite the unavoidable
  uncertainties in its foundation my theory would yet prove more than a
  mere work <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>of imagination, and that the future would
  find in it some durable points which would outlive the mutations of
  opinion. It is possible that one of these durable gains is my much
  impugned idea of determinants, and in fact not only will the present
  essay be made to rest on this idea, but it will also defend it on new
  grounds, although primarily only as a representation of something which
  we do not as yet exactly know, but which still exists and on which we can
  reckon, leaving it to the future to decide the greater or less
  resemblance of our hypothetical construct to nature.</p>

  <p>The real aim of the present essay is to rehabilitate the principle of
  selection. If I should succeed in reinstating this principle in its
  emperilled rights, it would be a source of extreme satisfaction to me;
  for I am so thoroughly convinced of its indispensability as to believe
  that its demolition would be synonymous with the renunciation of all
  inquiry concerning the causal relation of vital phenomena. If we could
  understand the adaptations of nature, whose number is infinite, only upon
  the assumption of a teleological principle, then, I think, there would be
  little inducement to trouble ourselves about the causal connexion of the
  stages of ontogenesis, for no good reason would exist for excluding
  teleological principles from this field. Their introduction, however,
  means the ruin of science.</p>

<h2>GERMINAL SELECTION.</h2>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>Numerous and varied are the objections that have been advanced against
  the theory of selection since it was first enunciated by Darwin and
  Wallace&mdash;from the unreasoning strictures of Richard Owen and the
  acute and thoughtful criticisms of Albert Wigand and Nägeli to the
  opposition of our own day, which contends that selection cannot create
  but only reject, and which fails to see that precisely through this
  rejection its creative efficacy is asserted. The champions of this view
  are for discovering the motive forces of evolution in the <i>laws</i>
  that govern organisms&mdash;as if the norm according to which an event
  happens were the event itself, as if the rails which determine the
  direction of a train could supplant the locomotive. Of course, from every
  form of life there proceeds only a definite, though extremely large,
  number of tracks, <i>the possible variations</i>, whilst between them lie
  stretches without tracks, <i>the impossible variations</i>, on which
  locomotion is impossible. But the actual travelling of a track is not
  performed by the track, but by the locomotive, and on the other hand, the
  choice of a track, the decision whether the destination of the train
  shall be Berlin or Paris, is not made by the locomotive, the cause of the
  variation, but by the driver of the locomotive, who directs the engine on
  the right track. In the theory of selection the engine-driver is
  represented by utility, for with utility rests the decision <!-- Page 12
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>as to what
  particular variational track shall be travelled. The cogency, the
  irresistible cogency, as I take it, of the principle of selection is
  precisely its capacity of explaining why fit structures always arise, and
  that certainly is the great problem of life. Not the fact of change, but
  the <i>manner</i> of the change, whereby all things are maintained
  capable of life and existence, is the pressing question.</p>

  <p>It is, therefore, a very remarkable fact, and one deserving of
  consideration, that to-day (1895), after science has been in possession
  of this principle for something over thirty years and during this time
  has steadily and zealously busied itself with its critical elaboration
  and with the exact determination of its scope, that now the estimation in
  which it is held should apparently be on the decrease. It would be easy
  to enumerate a long list of living writers who assign to it a subordinate
  part only in evolution, or none at all. One of our youngest biologists
  speaks without ado of the "pretensions of the refuted Darwinian theory,
  so called,"<a name="NtA5" href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and one of the
  oldest and most talented inquirers of our time, a pioneer in the theory
  of evolution, who, unfortunately, is now gone to his rest, Thomas Huxley,
  implicitly yet distinctly intimated a doubt regarding the principle of
  selection when he said: "Even if the Darwinian hypothesis were swept
  away, evolution would still stand where it is." Therefore, he, too,
  regarded it as not impossible that this hypothesis should disappear from
  among <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>the great explanatory principles by which we
  seek to approach nearer to the secrets of nature.</p>

  <p>I am not of that opinion. I see in the growth of doubts regarding the
  principle of selection and in the pronounced and frequently bitter
  opposition which it encounters, a transient depression only of the wave
  of opinion, in which every scientific theory must descend after having
  been exalted, here perhaps with undue swiftness, to the highest pitch of
  recognition. It is the natural reaction from its overestimation, which is
  now followed by an equally exaggerated underestimation. The principle of
  selection was not overrated in the sense of ascribing to it too much
  explanatory efficacy, or of extending too far its sphere of operation,
  but in the sense that naturalists imagined that they perfectly understood
  its ways of working and had a distinct comprehension of its factors,
  which was not so. On the contrary, the deeper they penetrated into its
  workings the clearer it appeared that something was lacking, that the
  action of the principle, though upon the whole clear and representable,
  yet when carefully looked into encountered numerous difficulties, which
  were formidable, for the reason that we were unsuccessful in tracing out
  the actual details of the individual process, and, therefore, in
  <i>fixing</i> the phenomenon as it actually occurred. We can state in no
  single case how great a variation must be to have selective value, nor
  how frequently it must occur to acquire stability. We do not know when
  and whether a desired useful variation really occurs, nor on what its
  appearance depends; and we have no means of ascertaining the space of
  time required for the fulfilment of the selective processes of nature,
  and hence cannot calculate the exact number of such <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span>processes that do and can
  take place at the same time in the same species. Yet all this is
  necessary if we wish to follow out the precise details of a given
  case.</p>

  <p>But perhaps the most discouraging circumstance of all is, that in
  scarcely a single actual instance in nature can we assert whether an
  observed variation is useful or not&mdash;a drawback that I distinctly
  pointed out some time ago.<a name="NtA6" href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  Nor is there much hope of betterment in this respect, for think how
  impossible it would be for us to observe all the individuals of a species
  in all their acts of life, be their habitat ever so limited&mdash;and to
  observe all this with a precision enabling us to say that this or that
  variation possessed selective value, that is, was a decisive factor in
  determining the existence of the species.</p>

  <p>In many cases we can reach at least a probable inference, and say, for
  example, that the great fecundity of the frog is a property having
  selective value, basing our inference on the observation that in spite of
  this fertility the frogs of a given district do not increase.</p>

  <p>But even such inferences offer only a modicum of certainty. For who
  can say precisely how large this number is? Or whether it is on the
  increase or on the decrease? And besides, the exact degree of the
  fecundity of these animals is far from being known. Rigorously viewed, we
  can only say that great fecundity must be advantageous to a
  much-persecuted animal.</p>

  <p>And thus it is everywhere. Even in the most indubitable cases of
  adaptation, as, for instance, in that of the striking protective coloring
  of many butterflies, <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>the sole ground of inference that the
  species upon the whole is adequately adapted to its conditions of life,
  is the simple fact that the species is, to all appearances, preserved
  undiminished, and the inference is not at all permissible that just this
  protective coloring has selective value for the species, that is, that if
  it were lacking, the species would necessarily have perished.</p>

  <p>It is not inconceivable that in many species today these colorings are
  actually unnecessary for the preservation of the species, that they
  formerly were, but that now the enemies which preyed on the resting
  butterflies have grown scarce or have died out entirely, and that the
  protective coloring will continue to exist by the law of inertia<a
  name="NtA7" href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> only for a short while till
  panmixia or new adaptations shall modify it.</p>

  <p>Discouraging, therefore, as it may be, that the control of nature in
  her minutest details is here gainsaid us, yet it were equivalent to
  sacrificing the gold to the dross, if simply from our inability to follow
  out the details of the individual case we should renounce altogether the
  principle of selection, or should proclaim it as only subsidiary, on the
  ground that we believe the protective coloring of the butterfly is not a
  protective coloring, but a combination of colors inevitably resulting
  from internal causes. The protective coloring remains a protective
  coloring whether at the time in question it is or is not necessary for
  the species; and it arose as protective coloring&mdash;arose not because
  it was a constitutional necessity of the animal's organism that here a
  red and there a white, black, or yellow spot should be produced, but
  because it was <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span>advantageous, because it was necessary for
  the animal. There is only one explanation possible for such patent
  adaptations and that is selection. What is more, no other natural way of
  their originating is conceivable, for we have no right to assume
  teleological forces in the domain of natural phenomena.</p>

  <p>I have selected the example of the butterfly's wing, not solely
  because it is so widely known, but because it is so exceedingly
  instructive, because we are still able to learn so much from it. It has
  been frequently asserted that the color-patterns of the butterfly's wings
  have originated from internal causes, independently of selection and
  conformably to inward laws of evolution. Eimer has attempted to prove
  this assertion by establishing in a division of the genus Papilio the
  fact that the species there admit of arrangement in series according to
  affinity of design. But is a proof that the markings are modified in
  definite directions during the course of the species's development
  equivalent to a definite statement as to the <i>causes</i> that have
  produced these gradual transformations? Or, is our present inability to
  determine with exactness the biological significance of these markings
  and their modifications, a proof that the same have no significance
  whatever? On the contrary, I believe it can be clearly proved that the
  wing of the butterfly is a tablet on which nature has inscribed
  everything she has deemed advantageous to the preservation and welfare of
  her creatures, and nothing else; or, to abandon the simile, that these
  color-patterns have not proceeded from inward evolutional forces, but are
  the result of selection. At least in all places where we do understand
  their biological significance these patterns are constituted and
  distributed over the wing exactly as utility would require. <!-- Page 17
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span></p>

  <p>I do not pledge myself, of course, to give an explanation of every
  spot and every line on a wing. The inscription is often a very
  complicated one, dating from remote and widely separated ages; for every
  single existing species has inherited the patterns of its ancestral
  species and that again the patterns of a still older species. Even at its
  origin, therefore, the wing was far from being a <i>tabula rasa</i>, but
  was a closely written and fully covered sheet, on which there was no room
  for new writing until a portion of the old had been effaced. But other
  parts were preserved, or only slightly modified, and thus in many cases
  gradually arose designs of almost undecipherable complexity.</p>

  <p>I should be far from maintaining that the markings arose unconformably
  to law. Here, as elsewhere, the dominance of law is certain. But I take
  it, that the laws involved here, that is, the physiological conditions of
  the variation, are without exception subservient to the ends of a higher
  power&mdash;utility; and that it is utility primarily that determines the
  kind of colors, spots, streaks and bands that shall originate, as also
  their place and mode of disposition. The laws come into consideration
  only to the extent of conditioning the quality of the constructive
  materials&mdash;the variations, out of which selection fashions the
  designs in question. And this also is subject to important restrictions,
  as will appear in the sequel.</p>

  <p>The meaning of formative laws here is that definite spots on the
  surfaces of the wings are linked together in such a manner by inner,
  invisible bonds, as to represent the same spots or streaks, so that we
  can predict from the appearance of a point at one spot the appearance of
  another similar point at another, and <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>so on. It is an undoubted
  fact that such relations exist, that the markings frequently exhibit a
  certain symmetry, that&mdash;to use the words of the most recent observer
  on this subject, Bateson<a name="NtA8"
  href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>&mdash;a meristic representation of
  equivalent design-elements occurs. But I believe we should be very
  cautious in deducing laws from these facts, because all the rules
  traceable in the markings apply only to small groups of forms and are
  never comprehensive nor decisive for the entire class or even for the
  single sub-class of diurnal butterflies, in fact, often not so for a
  whole genus. All this points to special causes operative only within this
  group.</p>

  <p>If internal laws controlled the marking on butterflies' wings, we
  should expect that some general rule could be established, requiring that
  the upper and under surfaces of the wings should be alike, or that they
  should be different, or that the fore wings should be colored the same as
  or differently from the hind wings, etc. But in reality all possible
  kinds of combinations occur simultaneously, and no rule holds throughout.
  Or, it might be supposed that bright colors should occur only on the
  upper surface or only on the under surface, or on the fore wings or only
  on the hind wings. But the fact is, they occur indiscriminately, now
  here, now there, and no one method of appearance is uniform throughout
  all the species. But the fitness of the various distributions of colors
  is apparent, and the moment we apply the principle of utility we know why
  in the diurnal butterflies the upper surface alone is usually variegated
  and the under surface protectively colored, or why in the nocturnal <!--
  Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>butterflies the fore wings have the
  appearance of bark, of old wood, or of a leaf, whilst the hind wings,
  which are covered while resting, alone are brilliantly colored. On this
  theory we also understand the exceptions to these rules. We comprehend
  why Danaids, Heliconids, Euploids, and Acracids, in fact all diurnal
  butterflies, offensive to the taste and smell, are mostly brightly marked
  and equally so on both surfaces, whilst all species not thus exempt from
  persecution have the protective coloring on the under surface and are
  frequently quite differently colored there from what they are on the
  upper.</p>

  <p>In any event, the supposed formative laws are not obligatory.
  Dispensations from them can be issued and are issued <i>whenever utility
  requires it</i>. Indeed, so far may these transgressions of the law
  extend, that in the very midst of the diurnal butterflies is found a
  genus, the South American Ageronia, which, like the nocturnal butterfly,
  shows on the entire <i>upper</i> surface of both wings a pronounced
  bark-coloration, and concerning which we also know (and in this respect
  it is an isolated genus and differs from almost all other diurnal
  butterflies), that it spreads out its wings when at rest like the
  nocturnal butterfly, and does not close them above it as its relatives
  do. Therefore, entirely apart from cases of mimicry, which after all
  constitute the strongest proof, the facts here cited are alone sufficient
  to remove all doubt that not inner necessities or so-called formative
  laws have painted the surface of the butterflies' wings, but that the
  conditions of life have wielded the brush.</p>

  <p>This becomes more apparent on considering the details. I have remarked
  that the usually striking colorations of exempt butterflies, as of the
  Heliconids, <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>are the same on both the upper and the lower
  surfaces of the wings. Possibly the expression of a law might be seen in
  this fact, and it might be said, the coloration of the Heliconids <i>runs
  through</i> from the upper to the under surface. But among numerous
  imitators of the Heliconids is the genus Protogonius, which has the
  coloration of the Heliconids on its upper surface, but on its lower
  exhibits a magnificent leaf-design. During flight it appears to be a
  Heliconid and at rest a leaf. How is it possible that two such totally
  different types of coloration should be combined in a single species, if
  any sort of <i>inner</i> rigorous necessity existed, regulating the
  coloration of the two wing-surfaces? Now, although we are unable to prove
  that the Protogonius species would have perished unless they possessed
  this duplex coloration, yet it would be nothing less than intellectual
  blindness to deny that the butterflies in question are effectively
  protected, both at rest and during flight, <i>that their colorations are
  adaptive</i>. We do not know their primitive history, but we shall hardly
  go astray if we assume that the ancestors of the Protogonius species were
  forest-butterflies and already possessed an under surface resembling a
  leaf. By this device they were protected when at rest. Afterwards, when
  this protection was no longer sufficient, they acquired on their upper
  surface the coloration of the exempt species with which they most
  harmonised in abode, habits of life, and outward appearance.</p>

  <p>At the same time it is explained why these butterflies did not acquire
  the coloration of the Heliconids on the under surface. The reason is,
  that in the attitude of repose they were already protected, and that in
  an admirable manner. <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span></p>

  <p>That <i>exempt</i> diurnal butterflies should be colored on the upper
  and under surfaces alike, and should never resemble in the attitude of
  repose their ordinary surroundings, is intelligible when we reflect that
  it is a much greater protection to be despised when discovered than to be
  well, or very well, but never absolutely, protected from discovery.</p>

  <p>It has been so often reiterated that diurnal butterflies, as a rule,
  are protectively colored on the under surfaces, that one has some
  misgivings in stating the fact again. And yet the least of those who hold
  this to be a trivial commonplace know how strongly its implications
  militate against the inner motive and formative forces of the organism,
  which are ever and anon appealed to. No less than sixty-two genera are
  counted today in the family of diurnal butterflies known as the
  Nymphalidæ. Of these by far the largest majority are sympathetically
  colored underneath, that is, they show in the posture of rest the
  colorings of their usual environment. In a large number of the species
  belonging to this group the entire surface of the hind wings possesses
  such a sympathetic coloration, as does also the distant apex of the fore
  wings. Why? The reason is obvious. This part only of the fore wing is
  visible in the attitude of repose. Here, then,&mdash;as a zealous
  opponent of the theory of selection once exclaimed,&mdash;there is
  undoubted "correlation" between the coloring of the surface of the hind
  wing and of the apex of the fore wing. Correlation is unquestionably a
  fine word, but in the present instance it contributes nothing to the
  understanding of the problem, for there are near relatives and often
  species of the same genera in which this correlation is not restricted to
  the apex of the <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>fore wings, but extends to a third or even
  more of their wings, and these species are also in the habit of drawing
  back their wings less completely in the state of rest, thus rendering a
  larger portion of them visible. There are species, too, like the
  forest-butterflies of South America just mentioned, the Protogonius,
  Anæa, Kallima species, etc., which have nearly the <i>whole</i> of the
  under surfaces of their fore wings marked according to the same pattern
  with their hind wings, and these butterflies when at rest hold their fore
  wings free and uncovered by their hind wings. Where are the formative
  laws in such cases?</p>

  <p>Or, perhaps some one will say: "The covering by the hind wings hinders
  the formation of scales on the wing, or impedes the formation of the
  colors in the scales." Such a person should examine one of these species.
  He will find that the scales are just as dense on the covered as on the
  uncovered surface of the wing, and in many species, for example, in
  Katagramma, the scales of the covered surface are colored most
  brilliantly of all.</p>

  <p>But the facts are still more irresistible, when we consider <i>special
  adaptations</i>; for example, the imitation of leaves, which is so often
  cited. It is to be noted, first, that this sort of imitation is by no
  means restricted to a few genera, still less to a few species. All the
  numerous species of the genus Anæa, which are distributed over the
  forests of tropical South America, exhibit this imitation in pronounced
  and varied forms, as do likewise the American genera Hypna and Siderone,
  the Asiatic Symphaedra, the African Salamis, Eurypheme, etc. I have
  observed fifty-three genera in which it is present in one, several, or in
  many species, but there are many others. <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span></p>

  <p>These genera, now, are by no means all so nearly allied that they
  could have inherited the leaf-markings from a common ancestral form. They
  belong to different continents and have probably for the most part
  acquired their protective colorings themselves. But one resemblance they
  have in common&mdash;they are all <i>forest-butterflies</i>. Now what is
  it that has put so many genera of forest-butterflies and no others into
  positions where they could acquire this resemblance to leaves? Was it
  directive formative laws? If we closely examine the markings by which the
  similarity of the leaf is determined, we shall find, for example, in
  Kallima Inachis, and Parallecta, the Indian leaf-butterflies, that the
  leaf-markings are executed <i>in absolute independence of the other
  uniformities governing the wing</i>.</p>

  <p>From the tail of the wing to the apex of the fore wings runs with a
  beautiful curvature a thick, doubly-contoured dark line accompanied by a
  brighter one, representing the midrib of the leaf. This line cuts the
  "veins" and the "cells" of the wing in the most disregardful fashion,
  here in acute and here in obtuse angles, and in absolute independence of
  the regular system of divisions of the wing, which should assuredly be
  the expression of the "formative law of the wing," if that were the
  product of an internal directive principle. But leaving this last
  question aside, this much is certain with regard to the markings, that
  they are dependent, not on an <i>internal</i>, but on an <i>external</i>
  directive power.</p>

  <p>Should any one be still unconvinced by the evidence we have adduced,
  let him give the leaf-markings a closer inspection. He will find that the
  midrib is composed of two pieces of which the one belongs to the <!--
  Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span>hind
  wing and the other to the fore wing, and that the two fit each other
  exactly when the butterfly is in the attitude of repose, but not
  otherwise. Now these two pieces of the leaf-rib do not begin on
  corresponding spots of the two wings, but on absolutely non-identical
  spots. And the same is also true of the lines which represent the lateral
  ribs of the leaf. These lines proceed in acute angles from the rib; to
  the right and to the left in the same angle, those of the same side
  parallel with each other. Here, too, no relation is noticeable between
  the parts of the wings over which the lines pass. The venation of the
  wing is utterly ignored by the leaf-markings, and its surface is treated
  as a <i>tabula rasa</i> upon which anything conceivable can be drawn. In
  other words, we are presented here with a <i>bilaterally symmetrical</i>
  figure engraved on a surface which is essentially <i>radially
  symmetrical</i> in its divisions.</p>

  <p>I lay unusual stress upon this point because it shows that we are
  dealing here with one of those cases which cannot be explained by
  mechanical, that is, by natural means, unless natural selection actually
  exists and is actually competent to create new properties; for the
  Lamarckian principle is excluded here <i>ab initio</i>, seeing that we
  are dealing with a formation which is only passive in its effects; the
  leaf-markings are effectual simply by their existence and not by any
  function which they perform; they are present in flight as well as at
  rest, during the absence of danger, as well as during the approach of an
  enemy.</p>

  <p>Nor are we helped here by the assumption of <i>purely internal motive
  forces</i>, which Nägeli, Askenasy, and others have put forward as
  supplying a <i>mechanical</i> force of evolution. It is impossible to
  regard the <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>coincidence of an Indian butterfly with the
  leaf of a tree now growing in an Indian forest as fortuitous, as a
  <i>lusus naturæ</i>. Assuming this seemingly mechanical force, therefore,
  we should be led back inevitably to a teleological principle which
  produces adaptive characters and which must have deposited the directive
  principle in the very first germ of terrestrial organisms, so that after
  untold ages at a definite time and place the illusive leaf-markings
  should be developed. The assumption of pre-established harmony between
  the evolution of the ancestral line of the tree with its pre-figurative
  leaf, and that of the butterfly with its imitating wing, is absolutely
  necessary here&mdash;a fact which I pointed out many years ago,<a
  name="NtA9" href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> but which is constantly
  forgotten by the promulgators of the theory of internal evolutionary
  forces.</p>

  <p>For the present I leave out of consideration altogether the question
  as to the conceivable extent of the sphere of operation of natural
  selection; I am primarily concerned only with elucidating the process of
  selection itself, wholly irrespective of the comprehensiveness or
  limitedness of its sphere of action. For this purpose it is sufficient to
  show, as I have just done, <i>that cases exist wherein all natural
  explanations except that of selection fail us</i>. But let us now see how
  far the principle of selection will carry us in the explanation of such
  cases&mdash;natural selection, I mean, as it was formulated by Darwin and
  Wallace.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt but the leaf-markings readily admit of
  production in this manner, slowly and with a gradual but constant
  increase of fidelity, provided a single condition is fulfilled: <i>the
  occurrence of the <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>right variations at the right place</i>. But
  just here, it would seem, is the insurmountable barrier to the
  explanatory power of our principle, for who, or what, is to be our
  guarantee that dark scales shall appear at the exact spots on the wing
  where the midrib of the leaf must grow? And that later dark scales shall
  appear at the exact spots to which the midrib must be prolonged? And that
  still later such dark spots shall appear at the places whence the lateral
  ribs start, and that here also a definite acute angle shall be accurately
  preserved, and the mutual distances of the lateral ribs shall be alike
  and their courses parallel? And that the prolongation of the median rib
  from the hind wing to the fore wing shall be extended exactly to that
  spot where the fore wing is not covered by the hind wing in the attitude
  of repose? And so on.</p>

  <p>If I could go more minutely into this matter, I should attempt to
  prove that the markings, as I have just assumed, have not arisen
  suddenly, but were perfected very, very gradually; that in one species
  they began on the fore wing and in another on the hind wing; and that in
  many they never until recently proceeded beyond one wing, in other
  species they went only a little way, and in only a few did they spread
  over the entire surface of both wings.</p>

  <p>That these markings advanced slowly and gradually, but with marvelous
  accuracy, is no mere conjecture. But it follows that the right variations
  at the right places must never have been wanting, or, as I expressed it
  before: <i>the useful variations were always present</i>. But how is that
  possible in such long extensive lines of dissimilar variations as have
  gradually come to constitute markings of the complexity here presented?
  Suppose that the useful colors had not <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>appeared at all, or had
  not appeared at the right places? It is a fact that in constant species,
  that is, in such as are not in process of transformation, the variations
  of the markings are by no means frequent or abundant. Or, suppose that
  they had really appeared, but occurred only in individuals, or in a small
  percentage of individuals?</p>

  <p>Such are the objections raised against the theory of selection by its
  opponents, and put forward as insurmountable obstacles to the process.
  Nor are such objections relevant only in the case of protective
  colorings; they are applicable in all cases where the process of
  selection is concerned. Take the case of instincts that are called into
  action only once in life, as, for example, the pupal performances of
  insects, the artificial fabrication of cocoons, etc. How is it that the
  useful variations were always present here? And yet they must have been
  present, if such complicated spinning instincts could have taken their
  rise as are observable in the silk-worm, or in the emperor-moth. And they
  have been developed, and that in whole families, in forms varying in all
  species, and in every case adapted to the special wants of the
  species.</p>

  <p>Particularly striking is the proof afforded of this constant presence
  of the useful variations by cases where we meet with the development of
  highly special adaptations that are uncommon even for the group of
  organisms concerned. Such a case, for example, is the apparatus designed
  for the capture of small animals and their digestion, found in widely
  different plants and widely separated families. On the other hand, very
  common adaptations, such as the eyes of animals, show distinctly that in
  all cases where it was necessary, the useful variations for the formation
  of <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span>an eye were presented, and were presented
  further exactly at spots at which organs of vision could perform their
  best work: thus, in Turbellaria and many other worms that live in the
  light, at the anterior extremity of the body and on the dorsal surface;
  in certain mussels, on the edge of the mantle; in terrestrial snails, on
  the antennæ; in certain tropical marine snails inhabiting shallow waters,
  on the back; and in the chitons even on the dorsal surface of the
  shell!</p>

  <p>But even taking the very simplest cases of selection, it is impossible
  to do without this assumption, that the useful variations are always
  present, or that <i>they always exist in a sufficiently large number of
  individuals for the selective process</i>. You know the thickness and
  power of resistance of the egg-shells of round-worms. The eggs of the
  round-worms of horses have been known to continue their course of
  development undisturbed even after they had been thrown into strong
  alcohol and all other kinds of injurious liquids&mdash;much to the
  vexation of the embryologists, who wished to preserve a definite stage of
  development and sought to kill the embryo at that stage. Indeed, think of
  the result, if in the course of their phylogenesis stout and resistant
  variations of egg-shells had not been presented in these worms, or had
  not always been presented, or had not been presented in every generation
  and not in sufficient quantities.</p>

  <p>The cogency of the facts is absolutely overpowering when we consider
  that practically no modification occurs <i>alone</i>, that every primary
  modification brings in its train secondary ones, and that these induce
  forced modifications in many parts of the body, frequently of the most
  diversified, or even self-contradictory, forms. Recently Herbert Spencer
  has drawn <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>fresh attention to these secondary
  modifications, which must always occur in harmony with the primary one,
  and has, as he thinks, advanced in this set of facts, a convincing
  disproof of the contention that such coadaptive modifications of numerous
  cofunctioning parts can rest on natural selection. Now, although I deem
  his conclusion precipitate, yet the very fact of a simultaneous,
  functionally concordant, yet essentially diversified modification of
  numerous parts, points conclusively to the circumstance that <i>something
  is still wanting to the selection of Darwin and Wallace, which it is
  obligatory on us to discover, if we possibly can</i>, and without which
  selection as yet offers no complete explanation of the phyletic processes
  of transformation. There is a hidden secret to be unriddled here before
  we can obtain a satisfactory insight into the phenomena in question.
  <i>We must seek to discover why it happens that the useful variations are
  always present.</i></p>

  <p>Herbert Spencer appealed to Lamarck's principle for the explanation of
  coadaptation, and it is certain that functional adaptation is operative
  during the individual life, and that it compensates in a certain measure
  the inequalities of the inherited constitutions. I shall not repeat what
  I have said before on this subject, nor maintain, in refutation of
  Spencer's contention, that functional adaptation is itself nothing more
  than the efflux of <i>intra-biontic</i> selective processes, as Spencer
  himself once suggested in a prophetic moment, but which it was left for
  Wilhelm Roux to introduce into science as "the struggle of the parts" of
  organisms.<a name="NtA10" href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> I shall only
  remark that if functional adaptations were themselves inheritable, this
  would still be insufficient <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span>for the explanation of coadaptation, for the
  reason that precisely similar coadaptive modifications occur in <i>purely
  passively</i> functioning parts, in which, consequently, modification
  <i>by</i> function is excluded. This is the case with the skeletal parts
  of Articulata; e. g., it is true of their articular surfaces with their
  complex adaptations to the most varied forms of locomotion. In all these
  cases the ready-made, hard, unalterable, chitinous part is <i>first</i>
  set into activity; consequently its adaptation to the function must have
  been <i>previously</i> effected, independently of that function. These
  joints, and divers other parts, accordingly, have been developed in the
  precisest manner for the function, and the latter could have had no
  direct share in their formation. When we consider, now, that it is
  impossible that every one of the numerous surfaces, ridges, furrows, and
  corners found in a single such articulation, let alone in all the
  articulations of the body, should hold in its hands the power of life and
  death over individuals for untold successions of generations, the fact is
  again unmistakably impressed upon our attention that the conception of
  the selective processes which has hitherto obtained is insufficient, that
  the root of the process in fact lies deeper, that it is to be found in
  the place where it is determined what variations of the parts of the
  organism shall appear&mdash;namely <i>in the germ</i>.</p>

  <p>The phenomena observed in the <i>stunting</i>, or <i>degeneration</i>,
  <i>of parts rendered useless</i>, point to the same conclusion. They show
  distinctly that ordinary selection which operates by the removal of
  entire persons, <i>personal selection</i>, as I prefer to call it, cannot
  be the only cause of degeneration; for in most cases of degeneration it
  cannot be assumed that slight individual <!-- Page 31 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span>vacillations in the size
  of the organ in question have possessed selective value. On the contrary,
  we see such retrogressions affected apparently <i>in the shape of a
  continuous evolutionary process determined by internal causes</i>, in the
  case of which there can be no question whatever of selection of persons
  or of a survival of the fittest, that is, of individuals with the
  smallest rudiments.</p>

  <p>It is this consideration principally that has won so many adherents
  for the Lamarckian principle in recent times, particularly among the
  paleontologists. They see the outer toes of hoofed animals constantly and
  steadily degenerating through long successions of generations and
  species, concurrently with the re-enforcement of one or two middle toes,
  which are preferred or are afterwards used exclusively for stepping, and
  they believe correctly enough that these results should not be ascribed
  to the effects of personal selection alone. They demand a principle which
  shall effect the degeneration by internal forces, and believe that they
  have found it in functional adaptation.<a name="NtA11"
  href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>On this last point, now, I believe, they are
  mistaken, be they ever so strongly convinced of the correctness of their
  view and ever so aggressive and embittered in their defence of it.</p>

  <p>Recently, an inquirer of great caution and calmness of judgment, Prof.
  C. Lloyd Morgan, has expressed the opinion that the Lamarckian principle
  must at least be admitted as a working hypothesis. But with this I cannot
  agree, at least as things stand at present. A working hypothesis may be
  false, and yet lead to further progress; that is, it may constitute an
  advance to the extent of being useful in formulating the problem and in
  illuminating paths that are likely to lead to results. But it seems to me
  that a hypothesis of this kind has performed its services and must be
  discarded the moment it is found to be at hopeless variance with the
  facts. If it can be proved that precisely the same degenerative processes
  also take place in such superfluous parts as have only <i>passive</i> and
  not active functions, as is the case with the <i>chitinous parts of the
  skeleton of Arthropoda</i>, then it is a demonstrated fact, that the
  cessation of functional action is not the efficient cause of the process
  of degeneration. At once your legitimate working hypothesis is
  transformed into an illegitimate dogma&mdash;illegitimate because it no
  longer serves as a guide on the path to knowledge but <!-- Page 33
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>blocks that
  path. For the person who is convinced he has found the right explanation
  is not going to seek for it.</p>

  <p>I can understand perfectly well the hesitation that has prevailed on
  this point in many minds, from their having seen <i>one</i> aspect of the
  facts more distinctly than the other. From this sceptical point of view
  Osborn has drawn the following perfectly correct conclusion: "If acquired
  variations are transmitted, there must be some unknown principle in
  heredity; if they are not transmitted, there must be some unknown factor
  in evolution."<a name="NtA12" href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Such in fact is the case and I shall attempt to point out to you what
  this factor is. My inference is a very simple one: if we are forced by
  the facts on all hands to the assumption that the useful variations which
  render selection possible are always present, then <i>some profound
  connection must exist between the utility of a variation and its actual
  appearance</i>, or, in other words, <i>the direction of the variation of
  a part must be determined by utility</i>, and we shall have to see
  whether facts exist that confirm our conjecture.</p>

  <p>The facts do indeed exist and lie before our very eyes, despite their
  not having been recognised as such before. All <i>artificial
  selection</i> practised by man rests on the fact that by means of the
  selection of individuals having a given character slightly more
  pronounced than usual, there is gradually produced a general augmentation
  of this character, which subsequently reaches a point never before
  attained by any individual <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span>of this species. I shall choose an example
  which seems to me especially clear and simple because only one character
  has been substantially modified here. The long-tailed variety of domestic
  cock, now bred in Japan and Corea, owes its existence to skilful
  selection and not at all to the circumstance that at some period of the
  race's history a cock with tail-feathers six feet in length suddenly and
  spasmodically appeared. At the present day even, as Professor Ishikawa of
  Tokio writes me, the breeders still make extraordinary efforts to
  increase the length of the tail, and every inch gained adds considerably
  to the value of the bird. Now nothing has been done here whatever except
  always to select for purposes of breeding the cocks with the longest
  feathers; and in this way alone were these feathers, after the lapse of
  many generations, prolonged to a length far exceeding every previous
  variation.</p>

  <p>I once asked a famous dove-fancier, Mr. W. B. Tegetmeier of London,
  whether it was his opinion that by artificial selection alone a character
  could be augmented. He thought a long time and finally said: "It is
  without our power to do anything if the variation which we seek is not
  presented, but once that variation is given, then I think the
  augmentation can be effected." And that in fact is the case. If cocks had
  never existed whose tail-feathers were a little longer than usual the
  Japanese breed could never have originated; but as the facts are, always
  the cocks with the longest feathers were chosen from each generation, and
  these only were bred, and thus a hereditary augmentation of the character
  in question was effected, which would hardly have been deemed
  possible.</p>

  <p>Now what does this mean? Simply that the <!-- Page 35 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>hereditary diathesis, the
  constitutional predisposition (<i>Anlage</i>) of the breed was changed in
  the respect in question, and our conclusion from this and numerous
  similar facts of artificial selection runs as follows: <i>by the
  selection alone of the plus or minus variations of a character is the
  constant modification of that character in the plus or minus direction
  determined.</i> Obviously the hereditary <i>diminution</i> of a part is
  also effected by the simple selection of the individuals in each
  generation possessing the smallest parts, as is proved, for example, by
  the tiny bills and feet of numerous breeds of doves. We may assert,
  therefore, in general terms: a definitely directed progressive variation
  of a given part is produced by continued selection in that definite
  direction. This is no hypothesis, but a direct inference from the facts
  and may also be expressed as follows: <i>By a selection of the kind
  referred to the germ is progressively modified in a manner corresponding
  with the production of a definitely directed progressive variation of the
  part.</i></p>

  <p>In this general form the proposition is not likely to encounter
  opposition, as certainly no one is prepared to uphold the view that the
  germ remains unchanged whilst the products proceeding from it, its
  descendants, are modified. On the contrary, all will agree when I say
  that the germ in this case must have undergone modifications, and that
  their character must correspond with the modifications undergone by its
  products. Thus far, then, we find ourselves, not on the ground of the
  hypothesis that has been lately so much maligned, but on the ground of
  facts and of direct inferences from facts. But if we attempt to pierce
  deeper into the problem, we are in need of the hypothesis. <!-- Page 36
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span></p>

  <p>The first and most natural explanation will be this&mdash;that through
  selection the zero-point, about which, figuratively speaking, the organ
  may be said to oscillate in its plus and minus variations, is displaced
  upwards or downwards. Darwin himself assumed that the variations
  oscillated about a mean point, and the statistical researches of Galton,
  Weldon, and others have furnished a proof of the assumption. If
  selection, now, always picks out the plus variations for imitation,
  perforce, then, the mean or zero-point will be displaced in the upward
  direction, and the variations of the following generation will oscillate
  about a higher mean than before. This elevation of the zero-point of a
  variation would be continued in this manner until the total equilibrium
  of the organism was in danger of being disturbed.</p>

  <p>There is involved here, however, an assumption which is by no means
  self-evident, that every advancement gained by the variation in question
  constitutes a new centre for the variations occurring in the following
  generation. <i>That this is a fact</i>, is proved by such actual results
  of selection as are obtained in the case of the Japanese cock. But the
  question remains, Why is this the fact?</p>

  <p>Now here, I think, my theory of determinants gives a satisfactory
  answer. According to that theory every independently and hereditarily
  variable part is represented in the germ by a <i>determinant</i>, that is
  by a determinative group of vital units, whose size and power of
  assimilation correspond to the size and vigor of the part. These
  determinants multiply, as do all vital units, by growth and division, and
  necessarily they increase rapidly in every individual, and the more
  rapidly the greater the quantity of the germinal cells <!-- Page 37
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>the individual
  produces. And since there is no more reason for excluding irregularities
  of passive nutrition, and of the supply of nutriment in these minute,
  microscopically invisible parts, than there is in the larger visible
  parts of the cells, tissues, and organs, consequently the descendants of
  a determinant can never all be exactly alike in size and capacity of
  assimilation, but they will oscillate in this respect to and fro about
  the maternal determinant as about their zero-point, and will be partly
  greater, partly smaller, and partly of the same size as that. In these
  oscillations, now, the material for further selection is presented, and
  in the inevitable fluctuations of the nutrient supply I see the reason
  why every stage attained becomes immediately the zero-point of new
  fluctuations, and consequently why the size of a part can be augmented or
  diminished by selection without limit, solely by the displacement of the
  zero-point of variation as the result of selection.</p>

  <p>We should err, however, if we believed that we had penetrated to the
  root of the phenomenon by this insight. There is certainly some other and
  mightier factor involved here than the simple selection of persons and
  the consequent displacement of the zero-point of variation. It would
  seem, indeed, as if in one case, <i>videlicet</i>, in that of the
  Japanese cock, the augmentation of the character in question were
  completely explained by this factor <i>alone</i>. In fact, in this and
  similar cases we cannot penetrate deeper into the processes of variation,
  and therefore cannot say <i>a priori</i> whether other factors have or
  have not been involved in the augmentation of the character in
  question&mdash;other characters, that is, than the simple displacement of
  the zero-point. There is, however, another class of phyletic
  modifications, which point <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>{38}</span>unmistakably to the conclusion that the
  displacement of the zero-point of variation by personal selection is not
  and cannot be the only factor in the determination and accomplishment of
  the direction of variation. I refer to <i>retrogressive development</i>,
  the gradual degeneration of parts or characters that have grown useless,
  the gradual disappearance of the eye in cave-animals, of the legs in
  snakes and whales, of the wings in certain female butterflies, in short,
  to that entire enormous mass of facts comprehended under the designation
  of "rudimentary organs."</p>

  <p>I have endeavored on a previous occasion to point out the significance
  of the part played in the great process of animate evolution by these
  retrogressive growths, and I made at the time the statement that "the
  phenomena of retrogressive growth enabled us in a greater measure almost
  than those of progressive growth to penetrate to the causes which produce
  the transformations of animate nature." Although at that time<a
  name="NtA13" href="#Nt13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> I had no inkling of certain
  processes which today I shall seek to prove the existence of, yet my
  statement receives a fresh confirmation from these facts.</p>

  <p>For, in most retrogressive processes <i>active</i> selection in
  Darwin's sense plays no part, and advocates of the Lamarckian principle,
  as above remarked, have rightly denied that active selection, that is,
  the selection of individuals possessing the useless organ in its most
  reduced state, is sufficient to explain the process of degeneration. I,
  for my part, have never assumed this, <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>and I enunciated
  precisely on this account the <i>principle of panmixia</i>. Now, although
  this, as I still have no reason for doubting, is a perfectly correct
  principle, which really does have an essential and indispensable share in
  the process of retrogression, still it is not <i>alone</i> sufficient for
  a full explanation of the phenomena. My opponents, in advancing this
  objection, were right, to the extent indicated and as I expressly
  acknowledge, although they were unable to substitute anything positive in
  its stead or to render my explanation complete. The very fact of the
  cessation of control over the organ is sufficient to explain its
  <i>degeneration</i>, that is, its deterioration, the disharmony of its
  parts, but not the fact which actually and always occurs where an organ
  has become useless&mdash;viz., <i>its gradual and unceasing diminution
  continuing for thousands and thousands of years culminating in its final
  and absolute effacement.</i></p>

  <p>If, now, neither the selection of persons nor the cessation of
  personal selection can explain this phenomenon, assuredly some other
  principle must be the efficient cause here, and this cause I believe I
  have indicated in an essay written at the close of last year and only
  recently published.<a name="NtA14" href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> I
  call it <i>germinal selection</i>.</p>

  <p>The principle in question reposes on the application, made some
  fifteen years ago by Wilhelm Roux, of the principle of selection to the
  <i>parts</i> of organisms&mdash;on the <i>struggle of the parts</i>, as
  he called it. If such a struggle obtains among organs, tissues, and
  cells, it must also obtain between the smallest and for us invisible
  vital particles, not only between those of the body-cells, strictly so
  called, but also between those of the <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>germinal cells. Roux
  himself spoke of the struggle of the molecules, by which he presumably
  understood the smallest ultimate units of vital phenomena&mdash;elements
  which De Vries designated pangenes, Wiesner plasomes, and I
  <i>biophores</i>, after Brücke's ingenious conception<a name="NtA15"
  href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> of these invisible entities had been
  almost totally forgotten, or at least had lain unnoticed for thirty
  years. No struggle, as that is understood in the theory of selection,
  could take place between real <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>molecules, for molecules are neither
  nourished, subject to growth, nor propagated.</p>

  <p>The gradual degeneration of organs grown useless may be explained,
  now, by the theory of determinants very simply and without any
  co-operation on the part of active personal selection, as follows.</p>

  <p>Nutrition, it is known, is not merely a passive process. A part is not
  only <i>nourished</i> but also actively <i>nourishes</i> itself, and the
  more vigorously, the more powerful and capable of assimilation it is.
  Hence powerful determinants in the germ will absorb nutriment more
  rapidly than weaker determinants. The latter, accordingly, will grow more
  slowly and will produce weaker descendants than the former.</p>

  <p>Let us assume, now, that a part of the body, say the hinder
  extremities of the quadruped ancestors of <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>our common whales, are
  rendered useless. Panmixia steps in, <i>i. e.</i>, selection ceases to
  influence these organs. Individuals with large and individuals with small
  hind legs are equally favored in the struggle for existence.</p>

  <p>From this fact alone would result a degradation of the organ, but of
  course it would not be very marked in extent, seeing that the minus
  variations which occur are no longer removed. According to our
  assumption, however, such minus variations repose on the weaker
  determinants of the germ, that is, on such as absorb nutriment less
  powerfully than the rest. And since every determinant battles stoutly
  with its neighbors for food, that is, takes to itself as much of it as it
  can, consonantly with its power of assimilation and proportionately to
  the nutrient supply, therefore the unimpoverished neighbors of this minus
  determinant will deprive it of its nutriment more rapidly than was the
  case with its more robust ancestors; hence, it will be unable to obtain
  the full quantum of food corresponding even to its weakened capacity of
  assimilation, and the result will be that its ancestors will be weakened
  still more. Inasmuch, now, as no weeding out of the weaker determinants
  of the hind leg by personal selection takes place on our hypothesis,
  inevitably the average strength of this determinant must slowly but
  constantly diminish, that is, the leg must grow smaller and smaller until
  finally it disappears altogether. The determinants<a name="NtA16"
  href="#Nt16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> of the useless organ are constantly at
  <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>a
  disadvantage as compared with the determinants of their environment in
  the germinal tenement, because no assistance is offered to them by
  personal selection after they have once been weakened by a decrease of
  the passive nutrient influx. Nor is the degeneration stopped by the
  uninterrupted crossing of individuals in sexual propagation, but only
  slightly retarded. The number of individuals with weaker determinants
  must, despite this fact, go on increasing from generation to generation,
  so that soon every determinant that still happens to be endowed with
  exceptional vigor will be confronted by a decided overplus of weaker
  determinants, and by continued crossing therefore will become more and
  more impoverished. Panmixia is the indispensable precondition of the
  whole process; for owing to the fact that persons with weak determinants
  are just as capable of life as those with strong, owing to the fact that
  they cannot now, as formerly, when the organ was still useful, be removed
  by personal selection, solely by this means is a further weakening
  effected in the following generations&mdash;in short, only by this means
  are the determinants of the useless organ brought upon the inclined
  plane, down which they are destined slowly but incessantly to slide
  towards their completed extinction.</p>

  <p>The foregoing explanation will be probably accepted as satisfactory
  <i>in a purely formal regard</i>, but it will be objected that, even
  granting this, it has not yet been proved to be the correct one. In
  answer I can of course adduce nothing except that it is at present the
  only one that can be given. It may be that the actual state of things in
  nature is different, but if it can be shown that a self-direction of
  variation merely from the need of it is at all conceivable by mechanical
  means, <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>{44}</span>that in itself, it seems to me, is a decided
  gain. It must also not be forgotten that some process or other
  <i>must</i> take place in the germ-plasm when an organ becomes
  rudimentary, and that as the result of it this organ, and only this
  organ, must disappear. Now in what shall this process consist, if not in
  a modification of the constitution of the germ? And how could the effect
  of such a modification be limited only to <i>one</i> organ which was
  becoming rudimentary if the modification itself were not a local one?
  These are questions which it is incumbent on those to answer who conceive
  the germinal substance to be composed of like units.</p>

  <p>Applying, now, the explanation derived from the disappearance of
  organs to the opposed transformation, namely, to the <i>enlargement</i>
  of a part, the presumption lies close at hand that the production of the
  long tail-feathers of the Japanese cock does not repose solely on the
  displacement directly effected by personal selection, of the zero-point
  of variation upwards, but that <i>it is also fostered and strengthened by
  germinal selection</i>. Were that not so, the phenomena of the
  transmutation of species, in so far as fresh growth and the enlargement
  and complication of organs already present are concerned, <i>would not be
  a whit more intelligible than they were before</i>. We should know
  probably how it comes to pass that the constitutional predisposition
  (group of determinants) of a <i>single</i> organ is intensified by
  selection, but the flood of objections against the theory of selection
  touching its inability to modify <i>many</i> parts at once would not be
  repressed by such knowledge. The initial impulse conditioning the
  independent maintenance of the useful direction of variation in the
  germ-plasm must rather be sought <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span>in the utility of the modification itself,
  and this also seems to me intelligible from the side of the theory. For
  as soon as personal selection favors the more powerful variations of a
  determinant, the moment that these come to predominate in the germ-plasm
  of the species, at once the tendency must arise for them to vary <i>still
  more strongly</i> in the plus direction, not solely because the
  zero-point has been pushed farther upwards, but because they themselves
  now oppose a relatively more powerful front to their neighbors, that is,
  actively absorb more nutriment, and upon the whole increase in vigor and
  produce more robust descendants. From the relative vigor or dynamic
  status of the particles of the germ-plasm, thus, will issue spontaneously
  an ascending line of variation, precisely as the facts of evolution
  require. For, as I have already said, it is not sufficient that the
  augmentation of a character should be brought about by uninterrupted
  personal selection, even supposing that the displacement of the
  zero-point were possible without germinal selection.</p>

  <p>Thus, I think, may be explained how personal selection imparts the
  initial impulse to processes in the germ-plasm, which, when they are once
  set agoing, persist of themselves in the same direction, and are,
  therefore, in no need of the continued supplementary help of personal
  selection, <i>as directed exclusively to a definite part</i>. If but from
  time to time, that is, if upon the average the poorest individuals, the
  bearers of the weakest determinants, are eliminated, the variational
  direction of the part in question, now reposing on germinal selection,
  must persist, and it will very slowly but very surely increase until
  further development is impeded by its inutility and personal selection
  <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>arrests the process, that is, ceases to
  eliminate the weaker individuals.</p>

  <p>In this manner it becomes intelligible how a large number of
  modifications varying in kind and far more so in degree can be guided
  <i>simultaneously</i> by personal selection; how in strict conformity
  with its adaptive wants every part is modified, or preserved unmodified;
  how a given articulation can undergo modifications, causing it to
  disappear on one side, to grow in volume on another, and to continue
  unaltered on a third. For every part that is perfectly adapted, although
  it can fluctuate slightly, yet can never undergo a permanent alteration
  in the ascending or descending direction because every plus and every
  minus variation which has attained selective value would be eliminated by
  personal selection in the course of time. Therefore, a definite direction
  of variation cannot arise in such cases and we have also reached, as it
  seems to me, a satisfactory explanation of the <i>constancy</i> of
  well-adapted species and characters.</p>

  <p>Hitherto I have spoken only of plus and minus variation. But there
  exist, as we know, not only variations of size but also variations of
  <i>kind</i>; and the coloration of the wings of butterflies, which we
  chose above as our example, would fall, according to the ordinary usage
  of speech, under just this head of variations of quality. The question
  arises, therefore, Have the principles just developed any claim to
  validity in the explanation of <i>qualitative</i> modifications?</p>

  <p>In considering this question it should be carefully borne in mind that
  by far the largest part of the qualitative modifications falling under
  this head rest on <i>quantitative</i> changes. Of course, chemical
  transformations, which usually also involve quantitative <!-- Page 47
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>alterations,
  cannot be reduced to the processes of augmentation described, inasmuch as
  these, by their very nature, can be effected only in living elements
  capable of increase by propagation; but the interference of selection
  does not begin originally with the constitutional predisposition
  (<i>Anlagen</i>) of the germ, i. e. with the determinants, but with the
  ultimate units of life, the <i>biophores</i>.</p>

  <p>A determinant must be composed of heterogeneous biophores, and on
  their numerical proportion reposes, according to our hypothesis, their
  specific nature. If that proportion is altered, so also is the character
  of the determinant. But disturbances of this numerical proportion must
  result at once on proof of their usefulness, or as soon as the
  modifications determined thereby in the inward character of the
  determinant turn out to be of utility. For fluctuations of nutriment and
  the struggle for nutriment, with its sequent preference of the strongest,
  must take place between the various species of the biophores as well as
  between the species of the determinants. But changes in the quantitative
  ratios of the biophores appear to us qualitative changes in the
  corresponding determinants, somewhat as a simple augmentation of a
  determinant, for example, that of a hair, may on its development appear
  to us as a qualitative change, a spot on the skin where previously only
  isolated hairs stood being now densely crowded with them, and assuming
  thus the character of a downy piece of fur. The single hair need not have
  changed in this process, and yet the spot has virtually undergone a
  qualitative modification. The majority of the changes that appear to us
  qualitative rest on invisible <i>quantitative</i> changes, and such can
  be produced at all times and <i>at all stages</i> <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span><i>of the vital units</i>
  by germinal selection. In a similar manner are induced the most varied
  qualitative changes of the corresponding determinants and of the
  characters conditioned thereby, just as changes in the numerical
  proportions of atoms produce essential changes in the properties of a
  chemical molecule.</p>

  <p>In this way we acquire an approximate conception of the possible
  mechanical <i>modus operandi</i> of actual events&mdash;namely, of the
  manner in which the useful variations required by the conditions of life
  <i>can</i> always, that is, very frequently, make their appearance. This
  possibility is the sole condition of our being able to understand how
  different parts of the body, absolutely undefined in extent, can appear
  as variational units and vary in the same or in different directions,
  according to the special needs of the case, or as the conditions of life
  prescribe. Thus, for example, in the case of the butterfly's wings it
  rests entirely with utility to decide the size and the shape of the spots
  that shall vary simultaneously in the same direction. At one time the
  whole under surface of the wing appears as the variational unit and has
  the same color; at another the inside half, which is dark, is contrasted
  with the outside half which is bright; or the same contrast will exist
  between the anterior and posterior halves; or, finally, narrow stripes or
  line-shaped streaks will behave as variational units and form contrasts
  with manifold kinds of spots or with the broader intervals between them,
  with the result that the picture of a leaf or of another protected
  species is produced.</p>

  <p>I must refrain from entering into the details of such cases and shall
  illustrate my views regarding the color-transformations of butterflies'
  wings by the simplest <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>conceivable example&mdash;viz. that of the
  uniform change of color on the entire under surface of the wing.</p>

  <p>Suppose, for example, that the ancestral species of a certain
  forest-butterfly habitually reposed on branches which hung near the
  ground and were covered with dry or rotten leaves; such a species would
  assume on its under surface a protective coloring which by its dark,
  brown, yellow, or red tints would tend toward similarity with such
  leaves. If, however, the descendants of this species should be
  subsequently compelled, no matter from what cause, to adopt the habit of
  resting on the green-leafed branches higher up, then from that period on
  the brown coloring would act less protectively than the shades verging
  towards green. And a process of selection will have set in which
  consisted first in giving preference only to such persons whose brown and
  yellow tints showed a tendency to green. Only on the assumption that such
  shades were possible by a displacement in the quantitative proportions of
  the different kinds of biophores composing the determinants of the scales
  affected, was a further development in the direction of green possible.
  Such being the case, however, that development <i>had to</i> result;
  because fluctuations in the numerical proportions of the biophores are
  always taking place, and consequently the material for germinal selection
  is always at hand. At present it is impossible to determine exactly the
  magnitude of the initial stages of the deviations thus brought about and
  promoted by the sexual blending of characters; but it may perhaps be
  ascertained in the future, with exceptionally favorable material. Pending
  such special observations, however, it can only be said <i>a priori</i>
  that slight changes in the composition of a determinant do not
  necessarily <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>condition similar slight deviations of the
  corresponding character,&mdash;in this case the color,&mdash;just as
  slight changes in the atomic composition of a molecule may result in
  bestowing upon the latter widely different properties. As soon, however,
  as the beginning has been made and a definite direction has been imparted
  to the variation, as the result of this or that primary variation's being
  preferred, the selective process must continue until the highest degree
  of faithfulness required by the species in the imitation of fresh leaves
  has been attained.</p>

  <p>That the foregoing process has actually taken place is evidenced not
  only by the presence of the beginnings of such transformations, as found
  for example in some greenish-tinted specimens of Kallima, but mainly by
  certain species of the South American genus Catonephele, all of which are
  forest-butterflies, and which, with many species having dark-brown under
  surfaces, present some also with bright green under surfaces&mdash;a
  green that is not like the fresh green of our beech and oak trees, but
  resembles the bright under surface of the cherry-laurel leaf, and is the
  color of the under surfaces of the thick, leathery leaves, colored
  dark-green above, borne by many trees in the tropics.</p>

  <p>The difference between this and the old conception of the
  selection-process consists not only in the fact that a large number of
  individuals with the initial stages of the desired variation is present
  from the beginning, for always innumerable plus and minus variations
  exist, but principally in the circumstance that the constant
  uninterrupted progress of the process after it is once begun is assured,
  that there can never be a lack of progressively advantageous variations
  in a large number of individuals. Selection, <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>therefore, is now not
  compelled to wait for accidental variations but produces such itself,
  whenever the required elements for the purpose are present. Now, where it
  is a question simply of the enlargement or diminution of a part, or of a
  part of a part, these variations are always present, and in modifications
  of quality they are at least present in many cases.</p>

  <p>This is the only way in which I can see a possibility of explaining
  phenomena of <i>mimicry</i>&mdash;the imitation of one species by
  another. The useful variations must be produced in the germ itself by
  internal selection-processes if this class of facts is to be rendered
  intelligible. I refer to the mimicry of an exempt species by two or three
  other species, or, the aping of <i>different</i> exempt patterns by
  <i>one</i> species in need of protection. It must be conceded to Darwin
  and Wallace that some degree of similarity between the copy and the
  imitation was present from the start, at least in very many cases;<a
  name="NtA17" href="#Nt17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> but in no case would this
  have been sufficient had not slight shades of coloring afforded some hold
  for personal selection, and in this way furnished a basis for independent
  germinal selection acting only in the direction indicated. It would have
  been impossible for such a minute similarity in the design, and
  particularly in the shades of the coloration, ever to have arisen, if the
  process of adaptation rested entirely <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>on personal selection.
  Were this so, a complete scale of the most varied shades of color must
  have been continually presented as variations in every species, which
  certainly is not the case. For example, when the exempt species <i>Acræa
  Egina</i>, whose coloration is a brick-red, a color common only in the
  genus Acræa, is mimicked by two other butterflies, a Papilio and a
  Pseudacræa, so deceptively that not only the cut of the wings and the
  pattern of their markings, but also that precise shade of brick-red,
  which is scarcely ever met with in diurnal butterflies, are produced,
  assuredly such a result cannot rest on accidental, but must be the
  outcome of a <i>definitely directed</i>, variation, produced by utility.
  We cannot assume that such a coloration has appeared as an
  <i>accidental</i> variation in just and in only these two species, which
  fly together with the <i>Acræa</i> in the same localities of the same
  country and same part of the world&mdash;the Gold Coast of Africa. It is
  conceivable, indeed, that non-directed variation should have accidentally
  produced this brick-red <i>in a single case</i>, but that it should have
  done so three times and in three species, which live together but are
  otherwise not related, is a far more violent and improbable assumption
  than that of a causal connexion of this coincidence. Now hundreds of
  cases of such mimicry exist in which the color-tints of the copy are met
  with again in more or less precise and sometimes in exceedingly exact
  imitations, and there are thousands of cases in which the color-tint of a
  bark, of a definite leaf, of a definite blossom, is repeated
  <i>exactly</i> in the protectively colored insect. In such cases there
  can be no question of accident, but <i>the variations presented to
  personal selection must themselves have been produced by the principle of
  the survival of the</i> <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span><i>fit!</i> And this is effected, as I am
  inclined to believe, through such profound processes of selection in the
  interior of the germ-plasm as I have endeavored to sketch to you to-day
  under the title of germinal selection.</p>

  <p>I am perfectly well aware how schematic my presentation of this
  process is, and must be at present, owing mainly to our inability to gain
  exact knowledge concerning the fundamental germinal constituents here
  assumed. But I regard its existence as assured, although I by no means
  underrate the fact that eminent thinkers, like Herbert Spencer, contest
  its validity and believe they are warranted in assuming a germ which is
  composed of <i>similar units</i>. I strongly doubt whether even so much
  as a <i>formal</i> explanation of the phenomena can be arrived at in this
  manner. So far as direct observation is concerned, the two theories stand
  on an equal footing, for neither my dissimilar, nor Spencer's similar,
  units of germinal substance can be <i>seen</i> directly.</p>

  <p>The attempt has been recently made to discredit my <i>Anlagen</i>, or
  constitutional germ-elements, on the ground that they are simply a
  subtilised reproduction of Bonnet's old theory of preformation.<a
  name="NtA18" href="#Nt18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> This <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>impression is very likely
  based upon ignorance of the real character of Bonnet's theory. I will not
  go into further details here, particularly as Whitman, in several
  excellently written and finely conceived essays, has recently afforded
  opportunity for every one to inform himself on the subject. My
  determinants and groups of determinants have nothing to do with the
  preformations of Bonnet; in a sense they are the exact opposites of them;
  they are simply <i>those living parts of the germ whose presence
  determines the appearance of a definite organ of a definite character in
  <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>the
  course of normal evolution</i>. In this form they appear to me to be an
  absolutely necessary and unavoidable inference from the facts. There
  <i>must</i> be contained in the germ parts that correspond to definite
  parts of the complete organism, that is, parts that constitute the reason
  why such other parts are formed.</p>

  <p>It is conceded even by my opponents that the reason why one egg
  produces a chicken and another a duck is not to be sought in external
  conditions, but lies in a difference of the germinal substance. Nor can
  they deny that a difference of germinal substance must also constitute
  the reason why a slight <i>hereditary</i> difference should exist between
  two filial organisms. Should there now, in a possible instance, be
  present between them a second, a third, a fourth, or a hundredth
  difference of hereditary character, each of which could vary from the
  germ, then, certainly, some second, third, fourth, or hundredth part of
  the germ must have been different; for whence, otherwise, should the
  heredity of the differences be derived, seeing that external influences
  affecting the organism in the course of evolution induce only
  non-transmissible and transient deviations? But the fact that every
  complex organism is actually composed of a very large number of parts
  independently alterable from the germ, follows not only from the
  comparison of allied species, but also and principally from the
  experiments long conducted by man in artificial selection, and by the
  consequent and not infrequent change of only a single part which happens
  to claim his interest; for example, the tail-feathers of the cock, the
  fruit of the gooseberry, the color of a single feather or group of
  feathers, and so on. But a still more cogent proof is furnished by the
  degeneration of parts grown <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>useless, for this process can be carried on
  to almost any extent without the rest of the body necessarily becoming
  involved in sympathetic alteration. Whole members may become rudimentary,
  like the hind limbs of the whale, or it may be only single toes or parts
  of toes; the whole wing may degenerate in the females of a butterfly
  species, or only a small circular group of wing-scales, in the place of
  which a so-called "window" arises. A single vein of the wing also may
  degenerate and disappear, or the process may affect only a part of it,
  and this may happen in one sex only of a species. In such cases the rest
  of the body may remain absolutely unaltered; only a stone is taken out of
  the mosaic.</p>

  <p>The assumption, thus, appears to me irresistible, that every such
  hereditary and likewise independent and very slight change of the body
  rests on some alteration of a <i>single</i> definite particle of the
  germinal substance, and not as Spencer and his followers would have it,
  on a change of <i>all</i> the units of the germ. If the germinal
  substance consisted wholly of like units, then in every change, were it
  only of a single character, <i>each</i> of these units would have to
  undergo exactly the same modification. Now I do not see how this is
  possible.</p>

  <p>But it may be that Spencer's assumption is the <i>simpler</i> one?
  Quite the contrary, its simplicity is merely apparent. Whilst my theory
  needs for each modification only a modification of <i>one</i>
  constitutional element of the germ, that is, of <i>one</i> particle of
  the germinal substance, according to Spencer <i>every</i> particle of
  that substance must change, for they are all supposed to be and to remain
  alike. But seeing that all hereditary differences, be they of
  individuals, races, <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>or species, must be contained in the germ,
  the obligation rests on these similar units, or rather the capacity is
  required of them, to produce in themselves a truly enormous number of
  differences. But this is possible only provided their composition is an
  exceedingly complex one, or only on the condition that in every one of
  them are contained as many alterable particles as according to my view
  there are contained determinants in the whole germ. <i>The differences
  that I put into the whole germ, Spencer and his followers are obliged to
  put into every single unit of the germinal substance.</i> My position on
  this point appears to me incontrovertible so long as it is certain that
  the single characters can vary hereditarily; for, if a thing can vary
  independently, that is, <i>of its own accord</i>, and <i>from the
  germ</i>, then that thing must be represented in the germ by some
  particle of the substance, <i>and be represented there in such wise that
  a change of the representative particle produces no other change in the
  organism developing from the germ than such as are connected with the
  part which depends on it</i>. I conceive that even on the assumption of
  my constitutional elements (<i>Anlagen</i>) the germ-plasm is complex
  enough, and that there is no need of increasing its complexity to a
  fabulous extent. Be that as it may, the person who fancies he can produce
  a complex organism from a <i>really</i> simple germinal substance is
  mistaken: he has not yet thoroughly pondered the problem. The so-called
  "epigenetic" theory with its <i>similar</i> germinal units is therefore
  naught else than an evolution-theory where the primary constitutional
  elements are reduced to the molecules and atoms&mdash;a view which in my
  judgment is inadmissible. A <i>real</i> <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>epigenesis from
  absolutely <i>homogeneous</i> and not merely <i>like</i> units is not
  thinkable.</p>

  <p>All value has been denied my doctrine of determinants<a name="NtA19"
  href="#Nt19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> on the ground that it only shifts the
  riddles of evolution to an invisible terrain where it is impossible for
  research to gain a foothold.</p>

  <p>Now I have indeed to admit that no information can be gained
  concerning my determinants, either with the aided or with the unaided
  eye. But fortunately there exists in man another organ which may be of
  use in fathoming the riddles of nature and this organ which is called the
  brain has in times past often borne him out in the assumption of
  invisible entities&mdash;entities that have not always proved unfruitful
  for science by reason of that defect, in proof whereof we may instance
  the familiar assumptions of atoms and molecules. Probably the biophores
  also will be included under that head if the determinants should be
  adjudged utterly unproductive. But so far I have always held that
  assumptions of this kind <i>are</i> really productive, if they are only
  capable of being used, so to speak, as a <i>formula</i>, whereby to
  perform our computations, unconcerned for the time being as to what shall
  be its subsequent fate. Now, as I take it, the determinants have had
  fruitful results, as their application to various biological problems
  shows. Is it no advance that we are able to reduce the scission of a form
  of life into two or several forms subject to separately continued but
  recurrent changes,&mdash;I refer to dimorphism and
  polymorphism,&mdash;that we are able to reduce such phenomena to the
  formula of male, female, and worker determinants? It has been, I think,
  <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>rendered conceivable how these diverse and
  extremely minute adaptations could have developed side by side in the
  same germ-plasm, under the guidance of selection; how sterile forms could
  be <i>hereditarily</i> established and transformed in just that manner
  which best suits with their special duties; and how they themselves under
  the right circumstances could subsequently split up into two or even into
  three new forms. Surely at least the unclear conception of an
  <i>adaptively</i> transformative influence of food must be discarded. It
  is true, we cannot penetrate by this hypothesis to the last root of the
  phenomena. The hotspurs of biology, who clamor to know forthwith how the
  molecules behave, will scarcely repress their dissatisfaction<a
  name="NtA20" href="#Nt20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> with such provisional
  knowledge&mdash;forgetful that <i>all our knowledge is and remains
  throughout provisional</i>.</p>

  <p>But I shall not enter more minutely into the question whether
  epigenesis or evolution is the right foundation of the theory of
  development, but shall content myself with having shown, first, that it
  is illusory to imagine that epigenesis admits of a simpler structure of
  the germ, (the precise opposite is true,) and secondly, that there are
  phenomena that can be understood only by an evolution-theory. Such a
  phenomenon is <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>the <i>guidance of variation by utility</i>,
  which we have considered to-day. For without primary constituents of the
  germ, whether they are called as I call them, determinants, or something
  else, <i>germinal selection</i>, or guidance of variation by personal
  selection, is impossible; for where all units are alike there can be no
  struggle, no preference of the best. And yet such a guidance of variation
  exists and demands its explanation, and the early assumptions of a
  "definitely directed variation" such as Nägeli and Askenasy made are
  insufficient, for the reason that they posit only <i>internal</i> forces
  as the foundations thereof, and because, as I have attempted to show, the
  harmony of the direction of variation with the requirements of the
  conditions of life subsists and represents the riddle to be solved.
  <i>The degree of adaptiveness which a part possesses itself evokes the
  direction of variation of that part.</i></p>

  <p>This proposition seems to me to round off the whole theory of
  selection and to give to it that degree of inner perfection and
  completeness which is necessary to protect it against the many doubts
  which have gathered around it on all sides like so many lowering
  thunder-clouds. The moment variation is determined substantially though
  not exclusively by the adaptiveness itself, all these doubts fall to the
  ground, with <i>one</i> exception, that of the utility of the initial
  steps. But just this objection is the least weighty. Without doubt the
  theory requires that the initial steps of a variation should also have
  selective value; otherwise personal selection and hence germinal
  selection could not set in. Since, however, as I have before pointed out,
  <i>in no case can we pretend to a judgment regarding the selective value
  of a modification, or have any</i> <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span><i>experience
  thereof</i>, therefore the assumption that in a given case where a
  character is transformed the original initial steps of the variation did
  have selective value, is not only as probable as the opposed assumption
  that they had none, but is <i>infinitely more probable</i>, for with this
  we can give an intelligible explanation of the mysterious fact of
  adaptation, while with that we cannot. Consequently, unless we are
  resolved to give up all attempts whatsoever at explanation, we are forced
  to the assumption that the initial steps of all actually affected
  adaptations possessed selective value.</p>

  <p>The principal and fundamental objection that selection is unable to
  create the variations with which it works, is removed by the apprehension
  that a germinal selection exists. Natural selection is not compelled to
  wait until "chance" presents the favorable variations, but supposing
  merely that the groundwork for favorable variations is present in the
  transforming species, that is, supposing merely that in the
  constitutional basis of the part to be changed are contained components
  which render favorable variations possible by a change of their numerical
  ratio, then those variations <i>must</i> occur, for the reason that
  quantitative fluctuations are always happening, and they must also be
  augmented as soon as personal selection intervenes and permanently holds
  over them her protecting hand. Not only is the marvelous <i>certainty and
  exactitude</i> with which adaptation has operated in so many individual
  cases, rendered intelligible in this manner, but what is more difficult,
  we are able to understand the <i>simultaneity</i> of numerous and totally
  different modifications of the most diverse parts co-operant towards some
  collective end, such as we see so frequently occur, <!-- Page 62 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>for example, in the
  simultaneous rise of instincts and protective similarities, or in the
  harmonious and simultaneous augmentation of two co-operant but
  independent organs, as of the eye and of the centre of vision, or of the
  nerve and its muscle, etc.</p>

  <p>The "secret law," of which Wolff prophetically speaks in his criticism
  of selection, is in all likelihood naught else than germinal selection.
  This it is that brings it about that the necessary variations are always
  present, that symmetrical parts, for example, the two eyes, usually vary
  alike, but under circumstances may vary differently, for example, the two
  visual halves of soles; that homodynamic parts, (for instance, the
  member-pairs of Arthropoda,) have frequently varied alike, and not
  infrequently and in conformity with the needs of the animal, have varied
  differently. It brings it about also that conversely species of quite
  different fundamental constitutions occasionally vary alike, as instances
  of mimicry and numerous other cases of convergence show us. As soon as
  utility itself is supposed to exercise a determinative influence on the
  direction of variation, we get an insight into the entire process and
  into much else besides that has hitherto been regarded as a
  stumbling-block to the theory of selection, and which did indeed present
  difficulties that for the moment were insuperable&mdash;as, for example,
  the like-directed variation of a large number of already existing similar
  parts, seen in the origin of feathers from the scales of reptiles. The
  utility in the last-mentioned instance consisted, not in the
  transformation of one or two, but of <i>all</i> the scales; consequently
  the line of variation of <i>all</i> the scales must have been started
  simultaneously in the same direction. A large part of the objections to
  the theory of selection <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>that have been recently brought forward by
  the acutest critics, as for example by Wigand, but particularly by
  Wolff,<a name="NtA21" href="#Nt21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> find, as I
  believe, their refutation in this doctrine of germinal selection. The
  principle extends precisely as far as utility extends, inasmuch as it
  creates, not only the direction of variation for every increase or
  diminution demanded by the circumstances, but also every qualitative
  direction of variation attainable by changes of quantity, so far as that
  is at all possible for the organism in question.</p>

  <p>Considering also the contrary process, the degeneration of useless
  parts by the cessation of selection in regard to the normal size of that
  part, a clear light is shed on that whole complex system of ascending and
  descending modifications which makes up most of the transformations of a
  living form, and we are led to understand how the fore extremity of a
  mammal can change into a fin at the same time that the <i>hinder</i>
  extremity is growing rudimentary, or how one or two toes of a hoofed
  animal can continue to develop more and more powerfully, whilst the
  others in the same degree grow weaker and weaker until finally they have
  disappeared entirely from the germ of most of the individuals of the
  species.</p>

  <p>Possibly some of that large body of inquirers, mostly paleontologists,
  who till now have considered the Lamarckian principle indispensable for
  the explanation of these phenomena&mdash;perhaps some, I say, will not
  utterly close their eyes to the insight that germinal selection performs
  the same services for the understanding of observed transformations,
  particularly of <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span>the degeneration of superfluous parts, that
  a heredity of acquired characters would perform, without rendering
  necessary so violent an assumption. I have always conceded that many
  transformations actually do run parallel to the use and disuse of the
  parts,<a name="NtA22" href="#Nt22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> that therefore it
  does really look as if functional acquisitions of the individual life
  were hereditary. But if it be found that <i>passively functioning
  parts</i>, that is, parts which are not alterable during the individual
  life by function, obey the same laws and also degenerate when they become
  useless, then we shall scarcely be able to refuse our assent to a view
  which explains both cases. It certainly cannot be the physiological
  function which provokes modifications in the individual, which are then
  subsequently transmitted to the germ and in this way made hereditary, if
  <i>functionless parts also change</i> when they become useless. It is
  precisely this <i>uselessness</i>, then, from which the initial impulse
  emanates, and the primary modification is not in the soma but in the
  germ.</p>

  <p>The Lamarckians were right when they maintained that the factor for
  which hitherto the name of natural selection had been exclusively
  reserved, viz., <i>personal</i> selection, was insufficient for the
  explanation of the phenomena. They were also right when they declared
  that panmixia in the form in which until recently I held the theory was
  also insufficient to explain the degeneration of parts that had grown
  useless, but they <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span>erred when they ascribed hereditary effects
  to the selection-processes which are enacted among the parts of the body
  (Wilhelm Roux) and which are rightly regarded as the results of
  functioning. And they did this, moreover, as they themselves admit, not
  because the facts of heredity directly and unmistakably required it, but
  because they saw no other possibility of explaining many phenomena of
  transformation. I am fain to relinquish myself to the hope that now after
  another explanation has been found, a reconciliation and unification of
  the hostile views is not so very distant, and that then, we can continue
  our work together on the newly laid foundations.</p>

  <p>That the application of the Malthusian principle was thoroughly
  justified is now clear. <i>The entire process of the development of
  living forms is guided by this principle.</i> The struggle for existence,
  <i>videlicet</i>, for food and propagation, takes place at all the stages
  of life between all orders of living units from the biophores recently
  disclosed upwards to the elements that are accessible to direct
  observation, to the cells, and still higher up, to individuals and
  colonies. Consequently, in all the divers orders of biological units
  lying between the two extremes of biophores and colonies, the
  modifications must be controlled by selective processes; therefore, these
  govern every change of living forms no matter what its significance, and
  bring it about that the latter fit their conditions of life as wax does
  the mould; and the various stages of these processes, as enacted between
  the divers orders of biological units, in all organisms not absolutely
  simple, are involved in incessant and mutual interaction. The three
  principal stages of selection, that of <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span><i>personal</i>
  selection<a name="NtA23" href="#Nt23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> as it was
  enunciated by Darwin and Wallace, that of <i>histonal</i> selection as it
  was established by Wilhelm Roux in the form of a "struggle of the parts,"
  and finally that of <i>germinal selection</i> whose existence and
  efficacy I have endeavored to substantiate in this article&mdash;these
  are the factors that have co-operated to maintain the forms of life in a
  constant state of viability and to adapt them to their conditions of
  life, now modifying them <i>pari passu</i> with their environment, and
  now maintaining them on the stage attained, when that environment is not
  altered.</p>

  <p>Everything is adapted in animate nature<a name="NtA24"
  href="#Nt24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and has been from the first beginnings
  of life; for adaptiveness of organisation is here equivalent to the power
  to exist, and they alone have had the power to exist who have permanently
  existed. <i>We know of only one natural principle of explanation for this
  fact&mdash;that of selection <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span>of the picking out of those having the power
  to exist from those having the power to originate.</i> If there is any
  solution possible to the riddle of adaptiveness to ends,&mdash;a riddle
  held by former generations to be insoluble,&mdash;it can be obtained only
  through the assistance of this principle of the self-regulation of the
  originating organisms, and we should not turn our faces and flee at the
  sight of the first difficulties that meet its application, but should
  look to it whether the apparent effects of this single principle of
  explanation are not founded in the imperfect application that is made of
  it.</p>

  <p>If I am not mistaken the situation is as follows: We had remained
  standing half way. We had applied the principle, but only to a portion of
  the natural units engaged in struggle. If we apply the principle
  throughout we reach a satisfactory explanation. Selection of
  <i>persons</i> alone is <i>not sufficient</i> to explain the phenomena;
  <i>germinal</i> selection must be added. Germinal selection is the last
  consequence of the application of the principle of Malthus to living
  nature. It is true it leads us into a terrain which cannot be submitted
  directly to observation by means of our organs of touch and by our eyes,
  but it shares this disadvantage in common with all other ultimate
  inferences in natural science, even in the domain of inorganic <!-- Page
  68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>nature: in
  the end all of them lead us into hypothetical regions. If we are not
  disposed to follow here, nothing remains but to abandon utterly the hope
  of explaining the adaptive character of life&mdash;a renunciation which
  is not likely to gain our approval when we reflect that by the other
  method is actually offered at least in principle, not only a broad
  insight into the adaptation of the single forms of life to their
  conditions, but also into the mode of formation of the living world as a
  whole. The variety of the organised world, its transformation by
  adaptation to new, and by reversed adaptation to old conditions, the
  inequality of the systematic groups, the attainment of the same ends by
  different means, that is, by different organisations, and a thousand and
  one other things assume on this hypothesis in a certain measure an
  intelligible form, whilst without it they remain lifeless facts.</p>

  <p>And so in this case, I may say, that again doubt is the parent of all
  progress. For the idea of germinal selection has its roots in the
  necessity of putting something else in the place of the Lamarckian
  principle, after that had been recognised as inadequate. That principle
  did, indeed, seem to offer an easy explanation of many phenomena, but
  others stood in open contradiction to it, and consequently that was the
  point at which the lever had to be applied if we were to penetrate deeper
  into the phenomena in question. For it is at the places where previous
  views are at variance with facts that the divining rod of the
  well-seekers must thrice nod. There lie the hidden waters of knowledge,
  and they will leap forth as from an artesian well if he who bores will
  only drive undaunted his drill into their depths.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead">I. THE REJECTION OF SELECTION.</p>

  <p>Many years ago Semper<a name="NtA25" href="#Nt25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
  denied the power of selection to create an organ, declaring that the
  organ must have previously existed before selection could have increased
  and developed it. More recently Wolff<a name="NtA26"
  href="#Nt26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> has distinguished himself by the vigor
  with which he has attacked the "task" of "setting aside the dogma of
  selection." Henry B. Orr<a name="NtA27" href="#Nt27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
  is also of opinion that selection is not the real cause of improved
  organic states; he regards it as a factor checking growth in certain
  directions, but not as a cause producing growth. Likewise Yves Delâge,<a
  name="NtA28" href="#Nt28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> in his recent voluminous
  but in many respects excellent work, regards natural selection solely as
  a subordinate principle which is devoid of all power to create species
  (p. 391), although he grants to it certain functions, and even
  characterises it <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>as "an admirable and perfectly legitimate
  principle" (p. 371). A more pronounced opponent of selection, of any
  kind, as a principle creating species, is the Rev. Mr. Henslow,<a
  name="NtA29" href="#Nt29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> whose views we shall
  discuss later, in Division VII. of this Appendix.</p>

  <p>Finally, must be mentioned the name of Th. Eimer, as that of a
  pronounced and bitter enemy of the theory of selection. I shall leave it
  to others to decide whether he can properly be called an "opponent" of
  the principle, in the scientific acceptance of the word. I can see in the
  blind railings of the Tübingen Professor nothing but a reiteration of the
  same unproved assertions, mingled with loud praises of his own doughty
  performances and captious onslaughts on every one who does not value them
  as highly as their originator.<a name="NtA30"
  href="#Nt30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The lack of confidence latterly placed in the theory of selection even
  by professed adherents of the doctrine, is well shown by such remarks as
  the following <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>from Emery,<a name="NtA31"
  href="#Nt31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> who says: "Some pupils of Darwin have
  gone beyond their master and discovered in natural selection the sole and
  universal factor controlling variations. Thus there has arisen in the
  natural course of things a reaction, especially on the part of those who,
  while they accept evolution, will have naught to do with natural
  selection or Darwinism as they call it." Emery then professes himself a
  Darwinian, although not in the sense of Wallace and "other co-workers and
  pupils of Darwin." For him "natural selection is a very important factor
  in evolution, and in determining the direction of variation plays the
  highest part; but it is far from being the only factor and is probably
  also not the most efficient factor." Not the most efficient factor but
  plays the highest part!</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead">II. CHEMICAL SELECTION.</p>

  <p>If we refer adaptation to selection, we have also to trace back to
  this source the origin of the organic combinations which make up the
  various tissues of the body and which go by the collective name of
  muscular, nervous, glandular substance, etc. Lloyd Morgan has prettily
  likened the vital processes to the periodic formation and discharge of
  explosive substances.<a name="NtA32" href="#Nt32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
  Unstable combinations are upon the application of a <!-- Page 72 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>stimulus suddenly
  disintegrated into simpler and more stable compounds; through this
  disintegration they evoke what is called the function of the
  disintegrating part&mdash;for example, certain changes of form (muscular
  contractions) or the excretion of the disintegrated products, etc.</p>

  <p>Now how is it possible that such unstable chemical combinations,
  answering exactly to the needs of life, could have arisen in such
  marvellous perfection if the <i>useful</i> variations had not always been
  presented to the ceaselessly working processes of selection? or, if the
  constantly increasing adaptation to the constantly augmenting delicacy of
  operation of physiological substances had depended in its last resort on
  <i>accidental</i> variations? Hence, not only with regard to the "form"
  of organs, but also with regard to the chemical and physiological
  composition of their materials, we are referred to the constant presence
  of appropriate variations.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead">III. VARIATION AND MUTATION.</p>

  <p>I have still to add a few remarks on the subject touched on in the <a
  href="#Nt11">footnote</a> at page <a href="#page31">31</a>. The view
  there referred to was discussed by Professor Scott before in an article
  published in the <i>American Journal of Science</i>, Vol. XLVIII., for
  November, 1894, entitled "On Variations and Mutations." Following the
  precedent of Waagen and Neumayr, Scott sharply discriminates between the
  inconstant vacillating variations which it is supposed [?] produce
  simultaneously occurring "varieties," and "mutations," or the
  successively evolved <i>time</i>-variations of a phylum, which constitute
  the stages of phyletic development. The facts on which this view is based
  are those already <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>adduced in the text&mdash;the
  <i>Zielstrebigkeit</i> (to use K. E. von Bär's phraseology) displayed in
  the visible paleontological development, the directness of advance of the
  modifications to a final "goal." "The direct, unswerving way in which
  development proceeds, however slowly, is not suggestive of many trials
  and failures in all directions save one." And again, "The march of
  transformation is the resultant of forces both internal and external
  which operate in a <i>definite manner</i> upon a changeable organism and
  similarly affect <i>large numbers of individuals</i>."</p>

  <p>The two points which I have here italicised are actually the facts
  which separate phylogenetic from common individual variation: the
  definite <i>manner</i> of the change, repeated again and again without
  modification, and its occurrence in a <i>large number of
  individuals</i>.</p>

  <p>Still the two are not solely a result of observation, deduced from
  paleontological data; they are also <i>a consequence of the theory of
  selection</i>, as was shown in the text. If the theory in its previous
  form was unable to fulfil this requirement, it is certainly now able to
  do so after germinal selection has been added, and it is not in any sense
  necessary to assume a difference of <i>character</i> between phylogenetic
  and ontogenetic variations. Bateson and Scott are wrong in imagining that
  I ask them "to abrogate reason" in pronouncing the "omnipotence of
  natural selection." On the contrary, the theory seems to me to accord so
  perfectly with the facts that we might, by reversing the process,
  actually construct the facts from the theory. What other than the actual
  conditions could be expected, if it is a fact that selection favors only
  the useful variations and singles them out from the rest by producing
  them in <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>increasing distinctness and volume with
  every generation, and also in an increasing number of individuals? The
  mere displacement of the zero-point of useful variations alone must
  produce this effect, especially when it is supported by germinal
  selection. It is impossible, indeed, to see how considerable, that is
  perceptible, deviations could arise at all on the path of phyletic
  development if in each generation a large number of individuals always
  possessed the useful, that is, the phyletic variations? In fact, by the
  assumption itself, the difference between useful and less useful
  variations is merely one of degree, and that a slight one.</p>

  <p>Hence, as I before remarked at page 31, I see no reason for assuming
  two kinds of hereditary variations, <i>distinct as to their origin</i>,
  such as Scott and the other palæontologists mentioned have been led to
  adopt, although with the utmost caution. I believe there is only one kind
  of variation proceeding from the germ, and that these germinal variations
  play quite different rôles according as they lie or do not lie on the
  path of adaptive transformation of the species, and consequently are or
  are not favored by germinal selection. To repeat what I have said in the
  footnote to page 31 only a relatively small portion of the numberless
  individual variations lie on the path of phyletic advancement and so mark
  out under the <i>guidance</i> of germinal selection the way of further
  development; and hence it would be quite possible to distinguish
  continuous, <i>definitely directed</i> variations from such as fluctuate
  hither and thither with no uniformity in the course of generations. The
  origin of the two is the same; they bear in them nothing that
  distinguishes the one from the other, and their success alone, that <!--
  Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>is, the
  actual resultant phyletic modification, permits their being known as
  phyletic or as vacillating variations. Uncertain fluctuations along the
  path of evolution are what the geologists would be naturally led to
  expect from the theory of selection, but which they were unable to
  discover in the facts; it is evident, however, that these fluctuations
  are not a logical consequence of the theory of selection as that is
  perfected by germinal selection, and there seems to me to be no reason
  now for attributing "variations" to the union of changing hereditary
  tendencies, while "mutations" are ascribed to the effect "of dynamical
  agencies acting long in a uniform way, and the results controlled by
  natural selection."</p>

  <p>The idea which the Grecian philosophers evolved of the thousands of
  non-adaptive formations that nature brings forth by the side of adaptive
  ones, and which must subsequently all perish as being unfit to live, is
  certainly correct in its ultimate foundations. But it is in need of far
  more radical refinement than it underwent in the hands of Empedocles, or
  than it seems likely to undergo at the hands of many contemporary
  inquirers. We know now that nature did not produce isolated eyes, ears,
  arms, legs, and trunks, and afterwards permit them to be joined together
  just as the play of the fundamental forces of love and hatred directed,
  leaving the monsters to perish and granting permanent existence only to
  harmonious products. Yet there is a weak echo of this conception,
  although infinitely far removed from its prototype, in the question as to
  where all the non-adaptive individuals are preserved that have perished
  in the struggle for existence and been eliminated from development by
  selection? Where, for example, are the fossil remains <!-- Page 76
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>of the rejected
  individuals in the line of the Horses? Certainly they should be
  forthcoming in far larger numbers than the individuals lying directly in
  the path of development, for by our very assumption the latter were
  greatly in the minority in every generation. Doubtless the question would
  be a proper one if our eyes were sufficiently keen-sighted to assign the
  life-value of the various minute differences that distinguish the
  "better" from the "worse" individuals of every generation. But this is a
  task which we can accomplish at best only with selective processes which
  are artificially directed by ourselves, as in the case of doves and
  chickens, and even there only with the utmost difficulty and only with
  reference to a single characteristic and not with any species which
  to-day exists in the state of nature. Picture, then, the difficulties
  attending such a task as applied to the meagre fossilic bones of
  prehistoric species, touching which the richest discoveries never so much
  as remotely approach to the actual number of individuals that have lived
  together for a <i>single</i> generation in the same habitat. If the
  differences between good and bad in a single generation were striking
  enough to be immediately remarked <i>as such</i> in fossil bones, the
  development of species would take place so rapidly that we could directly
  witness it in living species.</p>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="cenhead">IV. REMARKS ON THE HISTORY OF DEFINITELY DIRECTED
VARIATIONS.</p>

  <p>As to the attempt here made to apply the selective process to the
  elements of the germinal substance (the idioplasm) and thus to acquire a
  foothold for definitely directed variation not blind in its tendency but
  <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>{77}</span>proceeding in the direction of adaptive
  growth, it is remarkable that the same was not made long ago by some one
  or other of the many who have thought and written on selection and
  evolution.</p>

  <p>Allusions to a connexion between the direction of variation and the
  selective processes are to be found, but they remained unnoticed or
  undeveloped. I have been able to find at least two such observations, but
  would not wish to assert that there are not more of them hidden somewhere
  in the literature of the subject. One of them is old and comes from Fritz
  Müller. It was appended by his brother Hermann as a "Supplementary
  Remark" to his book <i>Die Befruchtung der Blumen durch Insecten</i>
  (1873) and is dated November 24, 1872. We read there: "My brother Fritz
  Müller communicates to me in a letter which reached my hands only after
  the bulk of the present work had passed through the press, the following
  law discovered by him, which materially facilitates the explanation by
  natural selection of the pronounced characters of sharply distinguished
  species: 'The moment a choice in a definite direction is made in a
  variable species, progressive modification from generation to generation
  in the same direction will set in as the result of this choice, wholly
  apart from the influence of external conditions. Transformation into new
  forms is thus greatly facilitated and accelerated.'"</p>

  <p>The facts on which F. Müller based the enunciation of his law, are the
  results of several experiments with plants, the numbers of whose grains
  (maize), or styles, or flowering leaves, were, by the exercise of choice
  in the cultivation, made to change in definite directions. Accurately
  viewed their significance is the same as that of numerous other cases of
  artificial selection, for <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>{78}</span>example, that of the long-tailed Japanese
  cock which was laid at the foundation of the theory in the text, although
  the numerical form of the observation gives more precision and
  distinctness to the reasoning based on them, than is to be observed in
  cases where we speak of characters as being simply "longer" or
  "shorter."</p>

  <p>F. Müller's opinion regarding the increase of characters by selection
  is expressed as follows: "The simplest explanation of these facts appears
  to be that every species possesses the faculty of varying within certain
  limits; the crossing of different individuals, so long as no choice is
  effected in a definite direction, maintains the mean round which the
  oscillations take place at the same points, and consequently the extremes
  also remain unaltered. If, however, one side is preferred by natural or
  artificial selection, the mean is shifted in the direction of this side
  and accordingly the extreme forms are also displaced towards that side,
  going now beyond the original limit. However, this explanation does not
  satisfy me in all cases."</p>

  <p>It is not known to me that F. Müller ever returned to this conception
  subsequently to the year 1872 or gave further developments of the same,
  nor have I been able to discover that it has been mentioned by other
  writers or incorporated in previous notions regarding selection.</p>

  <p>The second naturalist who has approached the fundamental idea of my
  doctrine of germinal selection, is a more recent writer. I refer to the
  English botanist Thiselton-Dyer, a scientist whose occasional utterances
  on the general questions of biology have more than once evoked my
  sympathetic approval. In an article, "Variation and Specific Stability,"
  which appeared in <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span><i>Nature</i> for March 14, 1895, this
  author enunciates twenty theses touching this subject, many of which
  appear to me apposite and correct, particularly the following: In every
  species there is a mean specific form round which the variations are
  symmetrically grouped like shots around the bull's eye of a target. As
  soon as natural selection comes into play and favors one of these
  variations it must shift the centre of density. Variations arise by a
  change in the outward conditions of life and can be useful or
  indifferent; only in the first case will natural selection obtain control
  of them and "the new variation will get the upper hand and the centre of
  density will be shifted."</p>

  <p>This is not germinal selection, but it is the same as what I have
  referred to in this and in the preceding essay as displacement of the
  zero-point of variation. Thiselton-Dyer did not draw the conclusion that
  a definitely directed variation answering to utility resulted from this
  process, which variation alone must cause the disappearance of useless
  parts, for the reason that he never attempted to penetrate to the causes
  of the shifting of the zero-point of variation. Neither Fritz Müller,
  whose utterances Thiselton-Dyer was obviously ignorant of, nor
  Thiselton-Dyer himself pushed his inquiries beyond the thought that the
  shifting in question resulted entirely in consequence of personal
  selection. There is no gainsaying that the degeneration of useless organs
  cannot be explained by personal selection alone, seeing that though the
  minus variations may possibly have a selective value at the beginning of
  a degenerative process, they certainly cannot have such in the subsequent
  course of the same, when the organ has dwindled down to a really minimal
  mass of substance as compared with the whole <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>body. Of what advantage
  would it be to the whale if his hinder leg, now concealed in a mass of
  flesh and no longer protruding beyond the skin, should still be reduced
  one or several centimetres in size? (Spencer.) If the minus variations
  have no selective value, how can the upper limit of the variational field
  be constantly displaced downwards, as actually happens? It is
  unquestionable but something different from personal selection must come
  here co-determinatively into play.</p>

<p class="cenhead">VI. THE INITIAL STAGES OF USEFUL MODIFICATIONS.</p>

  <p>In characterising as "least" weighty the old objection that the
  variations are too small at the start to be useful and to be selected, I
  find myself diametrically opposed to many writers of the present day, who
  have taken up with renewed vigor this old stumbling block to the
  principle of selection. Bateson<a name="NtA33"
  href="#Nt33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> regards the deficient proof of the
  utility of initial stages as the most serious objection that can be made
  to natural selection. New organs must in the necessity of the case have
  first been imperfect; how, then, could they have been selected since
  imperfect organs cannot be useful? Answers from various quarters have
  already been <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>made to this and to similar objections, and
  Darwin himself has referred to the fact that even the smallest variations
  may have selective value; Dohrn, too, has urged his principle of change
  of functions, which with regard to this question of the utility of
  initial stages has certainly a wide significance. Still, every
  transformation and new structure in the narrow sense of the word does not
  rest on change of function, and neither Darwin nor Wallace, nor any other
  more recent champion of the principle of selection, can ever succeed in
  demonstrating in <i>every</i> case the selective value of an initial
  stage. One reason why this cannot be done is because <i>in no case of
  morphological variation do we really know what these initial stages
  are</i>. To say that "new organs were at first necessarily imperfect"
  appears obvious enough, but it is at bottom a meaningless assertion, for
  it is not only possible but certain, that "imperfect" organs may still
  have selective value, and in by far the most cases have had selective
  value. The fact that we see to-day a long graduated line of
  forest-butterflies which possess resemblance to leaves and by this means
  are able in a measure to conceal themselves from prying eyes, yet that
  this resemblance in many species is very imperfect, in others more
  perfect, and in a very small number very perfect, simply proves that even
  "imperfect" formations may be of utility. The word "imperfect" in this
  connexion is itself very imperfect, for it is utterly anthropomorphic and
  estimates the biological value of a structure by our own peculiar
  artistic notions of its faithfulness to a leaf-copy, whilst we are really
  concerned here only with its protective value for the species in
  question, which is by no means dependent merely on the faithfulness of
  the copying, on the <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>faithfulness of the imitation, but on
  numerous other factors, such as the frequency and sharp-sightedness of
  the enemies of the species, the fertility of the species, their frequency
  and persecution in earlier developmental stages, and so forth, in brief,
  on their need of protection on the one hand and on their other means of
  protection on the other.</p>

  <p>Now all this cannot be exactly calculated in any given case, and it
  will be better, instead of haggling about individual cases concerning
  which we can never judge with certainty, to take the position adopted in
  the text and say: Since the utility of the initial stages <i>must</i> be
  assumed unless we are to renounce forever the explanation of adaptation,
  let us then take it for granted. No contradiction of facts is involved in
  this assumption; in fact, even individual variations exist whose eventual
  utility can be demonstrated, for example, the invisible differences
  enabling Europeans of certain constitutions to resist the attacks of
  tropical malarial fevers,&mdash;or the differences of structure, likewise
  not directly visible, which enable palms from the summits of the
  Cordilleras to withstand our winter climate better than palms of the same
  species from along the base-line of the mountains; and so on.</p>

<p class="cenhead">VII. THE ASSUMPTION OF INTERNAL EVOLUTIONARY
FORCES</p>

  <p>Definite variation was not only postulated in the last decade by
  Nägeli and Askenasy, but has also been repeatedly set up in recent years
  by various other authors. The Rev. George Henslow, in his book <i>The
  Origin of Species Without the Aid of Natural Selection</i>, 1894, regards
  the variations occurring in the state <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>of nature as always
  definite and not with Darwin as indefinite, and meets the objection that
  modification but not adaptation to outward conditions of life can be
  inferred from this fact, by the bold assumption that it is precisely the
  outward conditions of life or the environment which "induces the best
  fitted to arise." He further concludes that natural selection has nothing
  to do with the origin of species. At the basis of his conviction lies the
  naturally correct view that the summation of <i>accidental</i> variations
  is insufficient for transforming the species, but that definitely
  directed variation is necessary to this end. But concerning the way in
  which external conditions are always able to produce the fit variations,
  he can give us no information&mdash;if I am not mistaken, for the simple
  reason that such is not the fact, that the outward conditions only
  apparently determine the direction of variations whilst in truth it is
  the adaptive requirement itself that produces the useful direction of
  variation by means of selectional processes within the germ.</p>

  <p>C. Lloyd Morgan also has recently expressed himself in favor of the
  necessity of definite variation, though likewise without assigning a
  basis for its action, and without being able to show how its efficacy is
  compatible with the plain fact of adaptation to the conditions of life.
  He seeks to find the origin of variation in "mechanical stresses and
  chemical or physical influences," but this conception is too general to
  be of much help. He has, in fact, not been able to abandon completely the
  heredity of acquired characters.</p>

  <p>Emery<a name="NtA34" href="#Nt34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> likewise sees
  only the alternative of a <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span>"definitely directed variation" from
  internal causes and of a summation of "accidental" variations. He says:
  "A summation of entirely accidental variations in a given direction is
  extremely difficult," because "natural selection thus always awaits its
  fortune at the hands of accident whereby it is possible that the little
  good thereby produced will be swept away by other accidents
  (disadvantages of position) or obliterated in the following generations
  by unfortunate crossings." We can, therefore, continues Emery, well
  conceive "how many scientists look upon the whole theory of selection as
  a fable, or else throw themselves into the arms of Lamarckism."
  Unquestionably Emery has here singled out the insufficient points in the
  assumption of a selection of "accidental" variations; he has recognised
  the necessity of operating, not with single variations, but with
  "directions of variation." He has not, however, attempted the derivation
  of directed tendencies of variation from known factors; he apparently
  thinks of them as of something which has sprung from unknown
  constitutional factors and consequently ascribes to them the capacity of
  shooting beyond their mark, so to speak, that is, of acting beyond and
  ahead of utility, and so of producing modifications which may lead to the
  destruction of the species.</p>

  frequently quoted as if Newton were a downright contemner of scientific
  hypotheses. But if we read the passage in question in its original
  context, we shall discover that his renunciation of hypotheses referred
  solely to a definite case, viz., to that of universal gravitation, of
  whose character Newton could form no conception and hence was unwilling
  to construct hypotheses concerning it. Indeed, such a wholesale
  repudiation of hypotheses is antecedently incredible on the part of the
  inventor of the emission-theory of light, in which, to speak of only one
  daring conjecture, "fits" were ascribed to the luminous particles.

  <p><a name="Nt11" href="#NtA11">[11]</a> On the same day on which the
  present address was delivered at the International Congress of Zoölogists
  in Leyden, and on the same occasion, Dr. W. B. Scott, Professor of
  Geology in Princeton College, New Jersey, read a very interesting paper
  on the tertiary mammalian fauna of North America, in which, without a
  knowledge of my paper, he took his stand precisely on this argument and
  arrived at the opinion that it could not possibly be the ordinary
  individual variations which accomplished phyletic evolution, but that it
  was necessary to assume in addition phyletic variations. I believe our
  views are not as widely remote as might be supposed. Of course, I see no
  reason for assuming two kinds of hereditary variations, different <i>in
  origin</i>. Still it is likely that only a relatively small portion of
  the numberless individual variations lie on the path of phyletic
  advancement and so under the <i>guidance</i> of germinal selection mark
  out the way of further development; and hence it would be quite possible
  in this sense to distinguish continuous, <i>definitely directed</i>
  individual variations from such as fluctuate hither and thither with no
  uniformity in the course of generations. The root of the two is of course
  the same, and they admit of being distinguished from each other only by
  their success, phyletic modification, or by their failure.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt15" href="#NtA15">[15]</a> Delâge, in <i>La structure du
  protoplasma et les théories sur l'hérédité</i>, etc., Paris, 1895, is
  mistaken in attributing to Herbert Spencer the merit of having first
  pointed out the necessity of the assumption of biological units ranking
  between the molecule and the cell. Brücke set forth this idea three years
  previously to Spencer and established it exhaustively in a paper which in
  Germany at least is famous ("Elementarorganismen," <i>Wiener
  Sitzungsberichte</i>, October 10, 1861, Vol. XLIV., II., p. 381).
  Spencer's <i>Principles of Biology</i> appeared between 1864 and 1868;
  consequently there can be no dispute touching the priority of the idea.
  Strangely enough Delâge cites Brücke's essay in the Bibliographical Index
  at the end of his book correctly, although Brücke's name and views are
  nowhere mentioned in the book itself. It is to be observed, however, that
  the elementary organisms of Brücke are not merely the precursors of
  Spencer's "physiological units," but repose on much firmer foundations
  than the latter, which, as Delâge himself remarks, are at bottom nothing
  more than magnified molecules and not combinations of different molecules
  of such character as to produce necessarily phenomena of life. He aptly
  remarks on this point: "the physiological units of Spencer are only
  chemical molecules of greater complexity than the rest, and as he defines
  them they would be regarded as such by every chemist. He attributes to
  them no property <i>essentially</i> different from those of chemical
  molecules." Assimilation, growth, propagation, in short the attributes of
  life, are not attributed by Spencer to his units, while Brücke by his
  very designation "elementary organisms" expresses the idea of "ultimate
  living units," to use Wiesner's phrase. Of course this particular aspect
  of the vital units was not emphasised by Brücke with the same
  distinctness and sharpness as by recent inquirers, who took up Brücke's
  ideas thirty years after. I refer to the conception that the union of a
  definite combination of heterogeneous molecules into an invisibly small
  unit, forms the cradle or focus of the vital phenomena. This was first
  done and apparently on independent considerations by De Vries, and soon
  after by Wiesner, and subsequently by myself (De Vries, <i>Intracelluläre
  Pangenesis</i>, Jena, 1889; Wiesner, <i>Die Elementarstructur and das
  Wachsthum der lebenden Substanz</i>, Vienna, 1892; Weismann, <i>Das
  Keimplasma</i>, Jena, 1892). Let me say at the close of this note that it
  is not my intention in thus defending the rights of a great physiologist,
  to censure in the least the distinguished author of <i>L'hérédité</i> who
  has set himself a remarkably high standard of exactitude in such matters.
  Certainly, when we consider the enormous extent of the literature that
  had to be mastered to produce his book, embracing as it did all the
  various theories of recent times, such an oversight is quite
  excusable.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt16" href="#NtA16">[16]</a> I speak here of determinants,
  not of groups of determinants, which is the more correct expression,
  merely for the sake of brevity. It is a matter of course that a whole
  extremity, such as we have here chosen, cannot be represented in the germ
  by a single determinant only, but requires a large group of
  determinants.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt17" href="#NtA17">[17]</a> That this is not so in all cases
  has recently been shown by Dixey from observations on certain white
  butterflies of South America which mimic the Heliconids and in which a
  small, yellowish red streak on the under surface of the hind wing has
  served as the point of departure and groundwork of the development of a
  protective resemblance to quite differently colored Heliconids. "On the
  Relation of Mimetic Characters to the Original Form," in the <i>Report of
  the British Association for 1894</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt18" href="#NtA18">[18]</a> Oscar Hertwig, <i>Zeit-und
  Streitfragen der Biologie</i>, Jena, 1894. It is customary now to look
  upon the preformation-theory of Bonnet as a discarded monstrosity, and on
  the epigenesis of K. F. Wolff as the only legitimate view, and to draw a
  parallel between these two and what might be called to-day "evolution"
  [i. e. unfoldment] and epigenesis. The evolution, or unfoldment, of
  Bonnet and Harvey, however, was something totally different from modern
  doctrines of evolution, and Whitman is quite right when he says that even
  my theory of determinants would have appeared to the inquirers of the
  last century as "extravagant epigenesis." Biologists in that day were
  concerned with quite different questions from what they are at present,
  and although now we probably all share the conviction of Wolff that new
  characters do arise in the course of evolution, yet the acceptance of
  this view is far from settling the question <i>as to how these new
  characters are established in the germ-substance</i>&mdash;for in this
  substance they certainly must have their foundation. When, therefore, O.
  Hertwig laments over my regarding evolution and not epigenesis as the
  correct foundation of the theory of development, his sorrow is almost as
  naïve as is the statement of Bourne that epigenesis is a fact and not a
  theory "a statement of morphological fact," <i>Science Progress</i>,
  April, 1894, page 108), or, as is the latter's unconsciousness that facts
  originally receive their scientific significance from thought, i. e. from
  their interpretation and combination, and that thought is theory. And
  when S. Minot, as the leader of the embryologists, carries his zeal to
  the pitch of issuing a general pronunciamento against me as a corruptor
  of youth, in which he declares it to be a "scientific duty to protest in
  the most positive manner against Weismann's theory," I wonder greatly
  that he does not suggest the casting of a general ballot in the matter.
  (See the <i>Biologisches Centralblatt</i> of August 1, 1895.) We see how
  with these gentlemen the wisdom of the recitation-room regarding the
  infallibility of epigenesis has grown into a dogma, and whoever ventures
  to disturb its foundations must be burnt as a heretic.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt19" href="#NtA19">[19]</a> Oscar Hertwig, <i>Zeit- und
  Streitfragen der Biologie</i>, Jena, 1894.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt20" href="#NtA20">[20]</a> Nor will those, who demand a
  demonstration of "how the biophores and determinants are constituted in
  every case, and must be arranged in the architecture of the germ-plasm."
  (O. Hertwig, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 137). As if any living being could have
  the temerity even so much as to guess at the actual ultimate phenomena in
  evolution and heredity! The whole question is a matter of symbols only,
  just as it is in the matter of "forces," "atoms," "ether undulations,"
  etc., the only difference being that in biology we stumble much earlier
  upon the unknown than in physics.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt21" href="#NtA21">[21]</a> "Beiträge zur Kritik der
  Darwin'schen Lehre," <i>Biologisches Centralblatt</i>, Vol. X., p. 449.
  1890.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt22" href="#NtA22">[22]</a> Poulton has adverted to the fact
  that this is nevertheless not always the case; for example, it is not so
  with the teeth, whose shape it had also been sought to reduce to the
  mechanical effects of pressure and friction. See "The Theory of
  Selection" in <i>The Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural
  History</i>, Vol. XX., page 389. 1894.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt23" href="#NtA23">[23]</a> As the highest stage of
  selective processes must be regarded that between the highest biological
  units, the colonies or cormi&mdash;a stage, however, which is not
  essentially different from personal selection. In this stage the persons
  enact the part that the organs play in personal selection. Like their
  prototypes they also battle with one another for food and in this way
  maintain harmony in the colony. But the result of the struggle endures
  only during the life of the individual colony and can be transmitted
  through the germ-cells to the following generation as little as can
  histological changes provoked by use in the individual person. Only that
  which issues from the germ has duration.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt24" href="#NtA24">[24]</a> This statement has often been
  declared extravagant, and it is so if it is taken in its strict
  literalness. On the other hand, it would also seem, by a more liberal
  interpretation, as if there existed non-adaptive characters, for example,
  rudimentary organs. Adaptiveness, however, is never absolute but always
  conditioned, that is, is never greater than outward and inward
  circumstances permit. Moreover, an organ can only disappear gradually and
  slowly when it has become superfluous; yet this does not prevent our
  recognising every stage of its degeneration as adapted when compared with
  its precursor. Further, it does not militate against the correctness of
  the above proposition that there are also characters whose fitness
  consists in their being the necessary accompaniments of other directly
  adapted features, as, for instance, the red color of the blood.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt30" href="#NtA30">[30]</a> If any one should deem these
  words too severe, let him read the sarcastic passages in which Eimer has
  dispatched the late unfortunate Eric Haase who had been presumptuous
  enough to oppose the Tübingen Professor's deliverances on certain points.
  Haase, as we all know, fell a victim to the climate of the tropics,
  shortly after resigning the post of Director of the natural science
  collections in Bangkok, in order to return to Germany and to work out the
  fruits of his tropical sojourn. The unfortunate end of this accomplished
  man who had rendered important services to science had no effect in
  mollifying the resentment of Herr Eimer at the opposition which his views
  had encountered; and in twenty printed pages he takes him to task in the
  most personal and rancorous manner for this affront, remarking at the
  close: "In the meantime Herr Haase has died. Nevertheless I owe it to
  myself, in spite of this occurrence, to make public the foregoing facts,
  in order," etc. Any one who is interested in knowing the motives of Herr
  Eimer's excuse may find them in his book <i>Artbildung and Verwandtschaft
